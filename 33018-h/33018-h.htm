<h2><a name="Foreword" id="Foreword"></a>Foreword</h2>

<p>Tucked away among the hills and valleys in and near the
Shenandoah National Park and the Great Valley of Virginia are
stories of the beginnings of the white man's life beyond the
comparative ease of early Tidewater Virginia. These stories are
true ones and they depict something of the courage and hardihood
of the early Virginia pioneer. Perhaps in reading of their lives
we may catch something of the majesty and charm of their surroundings
which were reflected to a marked degree in their way
of living. Surely they must often have said, "I will look unto
the hills from whence cometh my strength" or how else may we
account for the developments which came as the result of their
constant struggle for survival?</p>

<p>Stories of colonial Virginia on the eastern seaboard are numerous
and usually exciting but they are quite different from the
tales beyond the Piedmont. A combination of them may enable
us to know Virginia as a whole in a more appreciative way.</p>

<p>Long before the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe ever set
foot in the wilds of Virginia, intrepid explorers had passed
through various parts of the Valley country.</p>

<p>In 1654&mdash;more than sixty years before the Governor's expedition&mdash;Colonel
Abraham Wood received permission to explore
beyond the mountains. His purpose was to establish trade relations
with the Indians. His journey carried him through the
lower Blue Ridge, crossing the range near the Virginia-North
Carolina line.</p>

<p>Reference is made elsewhere of the explorations conducted by
the one-time monk, John Lederer, whose journal of the trip was
first translated from German and published in London in 1672.</p>

<p>Let us plainly understand however that each of these trips was
of a migratory nature; not a thought was entertained by any of
the participants of remaining in the Virginia mountains. Any
white man found in these sections at this time was there because
of good hunting grounds, hopes of good trading, the zeal of a
missionary spirit or love of adventure and exploration.</p>

<p>The earliest settlers in the Valley in most part came either from
Maryland or Pennsylvania. They came in search of rich, cheap
land or for economic reasons or in the hope of establishing
greater freedom for themselves and their children.</p>

<p>Two nationalities invaded the Great Valley almost simultaneously:
the Germans and Scotch-Irish&mdash;both fine, sturdy, healthy
and thrifty stock which is reflected in marked degree among the
present inhabitants of the region. Their real interest in the new
settlements may truthfully be said to have begun about 1730
when land grants were obtained. About two years later the
actual move into the country and the house building commenced
in earnest.</p>

<p>The German settlers located chiefly along the territory extending
from Winchester to Staunton. The Scotch-Irish on the other
hand selected Staunton and the valley south of the town for their
claims. No nice distinction can be made so easily, for we shall
find the two groups interspersed all along the entire length of
the Valley. But generally speaking their domains may be defined
thus.</p>

<p>So much fighting during the wars of our country could not have
been fought in this section of the State without leaving in its
wake the stories of chivalry, courage and accomplishment, a few
of which are included.</p>

<p>It is our desire that the trips along the Skyline Drive and in
the Great Valley country may be enriched and the imagination
stirred because of the accounts included in this small book.</p>

<p>Alexander Spotswood was the first Virginia Governor to become
interested in the glowing accounts which the hunters and trappers
brought back from the hill sections of the colony. He determined
to see for himself those distant blue ridges.</p>

<p>And while historians have not told us who guided him to the
upper or western boundary of what was then Essex County, we
are told that he became enthusiastic over the rich iron ore which
he found in the peninsula formed by the Rapidan River. He
decided to build iron furnaces at a point near the river. Later he
had his agent, Baron de Graffenreid, go to Germany and bring
master mechanics and their families to Virginia.</p>

<p>The first German colony came in 1714 to Virginia and journeyed
to Germanna, as they called their new home on the bank
of the Rapidan River. They were made up of twelve families and
numbered forty-two people in all, men, women and children.</p>

<p>The Virginia Council passed an act which provided protection
for the Germans. A fort was built for them, ammunition and
two cannon were sent and an order was given for a road to be
made to the settlement.</p>

<p>These men and women were brave, loyal and deeply religious.
They belonged to the German Reformed Church, which was a
branch of the Presbyterian family of churches. Here they organized
the first congregation of that faith in America and here they
built their church. They had come from Westphalia, in Germany,
and of course had brought their own customs and manners, which
are not entirely gone even in our modern Virginia. Later, as we
shall see, many of this first colony left Germanna and settled on
Licking Run near Warrenton.</p>

<p>In 1717 came a second German colony to Germanna. They
too were brave, loyal, and devout; but were different from the
first, being Lutherans and representing twenty families from
Pennsylvania.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Two years later, the third colony of Germans came to Germanna
and from there they settled in Orange and Madison counties.</p>

<p>If Governor Spotswood earned the title of "Tubal Cain of
America", it was because these Germans were industrious, thrifty
and honest.</p>

<p>The Governor liked the neighborhood so well that he had a
palace built for his family. There was a terraced garden, which
one may trace in the ruins found there today. A courthouse
was built there, for a new county had been cut from Essex and
was called Spotsylvania, in the Governor's honor. Nearby was a
bubbling fountain spring at which tourists stop today to quench
their thirst. This has been marked by the Colonial Dames and
over it there is a hand-wrought iron standard, giving the legend
of the spring.</p>

<p>In 1732, Colonel William Byrd of Westover visited Governor
Spotswood at Germanna. He was one of the Commissioners who
ran the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina. He
held many positions of honor and trust in the colony. His writings
give an intimate picture of Governor Spotswood's settlement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h3><i>Progress to the Mines.</i></h3>

<p>"Here I arrived about three o'clock, and found only Mrs. Spotswood
at home, who received her old acquaintance with many gracious smiles.
I was carried into a room elegantly set off with pier glasses, the largest
of which came soon to an odd misfortune. Amongst other favorite
animals to cheer this lady's solitude, a brace of deer ran <a name="corr_1">
</a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: familarly">familiarly</ins>
about the house, and one of them came to stare at me as a stranger.
But unluckily spying his own figure in the glass, he made a spring
over the tea-table that stood under it, and shattered the glass to pieces,
and falling back upon the tea-table made a terrible fracas among the
china. This exploit was so sudden and accompanied with such a
noise, that it surprised me and perfectly frightened Mrs. Spotswood.
But it was worth all the damage to show the moderation and good
humor with which she bore the disaster. In the evening the noble
Colonel came home from his mines, who saluted me very civilly, and
Mrs. Spotswood's sister, Miss Theky, who had been to meet him <i>en
cavalier</i>, was kind too, as to bid me welcome.</p>

<p>"We talked over a legion of old stories, supped about nine, and
then prattled with the ladies till it was time to retire. In the meantime,
I observed my old friend to be very uxorious and exceedingly
fond of his children. This was opposite to the maxims he used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
preach before he was married, that I could not forbear rubbing up
the memory of them. But he gave a very good natural turn to his
change of sentiments, by alleging that whoever brings a poor gentlewoman
to so solitary a place, from all her friends and acquaintances,
would be very ungrateful not to use her and all that belongs to her
with all possible tenderness.</p>

<p>"We all kept snug in our apartments till nine, except Miss Theky,
who was the housewife of the family. At that hour we met over a
pot of coffee, which was not quite strong enough to give us the palsy.
After breakfast the Colonel and I left the ladies to their domestic
affairs, and took a turn in the garden which has nothing but three
terraced walks that fall in slopes one below the other.... I let him
know that I had come to be instructed by so great a master in the
mystery of making iron and that he led the way and was the Tubal
Cain of America.... He assured me he was not only the first in
this country, but the first in North America who had erected a
regular furnace, that they ran altogether upon bloomeries in New
England and Pennsylvania, till his example had made them attempt
greater works.... At night we drank prosperity to all the Colonel's
projects in a bowl of rack punch, and then retired to our devotions....</p>

<p>"I sallied out at the first summons to breakfast, where our conversation
with the ladies, like whipped sillibub, was very pretty, but had
nothing in it. This it seems was Miss Theky's birthday, upon which
I made her my compliments, and wished she might live twice as long
a married woman as she had lived a maid. I did not presume to pry
into the secret of her age, nor was she forward to disclose it....
She contrived to make this a day of mourning for having nothing
better at present to set her affections upon."</p></div>

<p>It was really from Germanna that the Great Expedition to the
Mountains began. Of course we know that Williamsburg was the
scene of great excitement when the Governor and some of his
staff gathered for the first start. The party consisted of the
Governor, Fontaine, whose diary gives us accounts of the journey,
Beverley, the historian of Virginia in 1703, Colonel Robertson,
Austin Smith, Dr. Robinson, Messrs. Talor, Brooke and Mason
and Captains Smith and Clouder. Others were gentlemen, servants
and guides. All were delayed when an old trapper told
them that their horses' feet would be ruined if not shod. In the
sandy soil of eastern Virginia it was not necessary to shoe one's
horse, but the rocks, as one travelled inland, would ruin the
horse's feet. The party made the best of the long wait by
drinking the health of the King, toasts to the maids left behind
and in other farewells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>The party, after five days, reached Germanna and it is from
Fontaine's journal that we are told of the details of the trip. He
relates the hardships; some, including the writer, had fevers and
chills and drank Jesuits' bark tea. Their beds, made of boughs,
were not soft enough and the men slept badly and were sore
the next day after camping out in the wilderness. They made
about six miles a day. Their food was bear's meat, venison, and
wild game, which they roasted on long wooden forks over glowing
coals. And each time they ate, they also drank the King's
health, not forgetting any of his children in their toasts. Fontaine
writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We saw when we were over the mountain the footing of elks
and buffaloes, and their beds. We saw a vine which bore a sort of
wild cucumber and a shrub with fruit like unto a currant. We ate
very good wild grapes.... We crossed a river which we called the
Euphrates. It is very deep, the main course of the water is north, it
is four score yards wide in the narrowest part.... I got some grasshoppers
and fished ... we catched a dish of fish, some perch and a
fish called Chub. The others went ahunting and killed deer and
turkeys.... I engraved my name on a tree by the river's side and the
Governor buried a bottle with a paper inside, on which he writ that
he took possession of this place in the name of King George the First
of England....</p>

<p>"We had a good dinner, and after it we got the men together
and loaded all their arms and we drank the King's health in champagne
and fired a volley, and the Princess's health in Burgundy and
fired a volley, and all the rest of the Royal family in claret and a
volley. We drank the Governor's health and fired a volley.</p>

<p>"We had several sorts of liquors, viz Virginian red wine and white
Irish usquebaugh, brandy, shrub, two sorts of rum, champagne, canary,
cherry punch water and cider."</p></div>

<p>It was thirty-six days after leaving Williamsburg that the party
finally reached the mountain and scaled Swift Run Gap and for
the first time a group of Englishmen looked down into the fertile
valley beyond.</p>

<p>The Governor was a romantic person, as well as practical, so he
wanted to have something tangible by which all of his party
might remember their thrilling trip. He asked some of his men
what they thought of the idea and someone suggested, no doubt
in fun, that they call themselves the "Knights of the Golden
Horseshoe".<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Anyway, historians relate that when he returned to Williamsburg,
he promptly wrote a letter to His Majesty and told him of
the wonderful country "beyond the mountains". He also asked
for a grant for the Order of the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe.
In due time a proclamation arrived from England creating The
Order of the Golden Horseshoe and also fifty tiny golden horseshoes
inscribed in Latin "<i>Sic jurat transcerde mantes</i>". There
was a seal and a signature and the title of Knight was conferred
upon the Governor.</p>

<p>The King also had his own sense of humor and included with
all the rest, the bill for the golden horseshoes! And we are told
the sporting Governor paid for them out of his own pocket
without any regrets.</p>

<p>Let us start our journey from this historic spot and drive along
the recently built Skyline Drive. As we go we may look down
upon the first settlers' homes, around which are built the thrifty
towns of today.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Adam_Miller_and_His_Neighbors" id="Adam_Miller_and_His_Neighbors"></a>Adam Miller and His Neighbors</h2>


<p>Among the earliest settlers in the valley were young Germans,
Adam Mueller and his wife and his sister. Adam, as was his
family, was born in Germany. Like many others, he had left
because of religious persecution, devastating wars and social
unrest. His first home in the new country was in Lancaster,
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Adam Miller (as his name was soon after spelled) journeyed
to Williamsburg, Virginia. There, he told someone, he wanted to
make his home. It was not long after the Knights of the Golden
Horseshoe had returned with their glowing accounts of the land
beyond the mountains. Adam listened with deep interest to the
descriptions of the Valley where a native grass grew on which
buffalo fattened, where game lived all year and where a forest
fringed the fertile valleys. He decided to go with some hunters
and he found the kind of land which he wanted. Before he
returned to Lancaster he had built a rude log cabin. He returned
home by way of Williamsburg, and soon his wife and sister were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
getting ready to set forth. Many of his German neighbors were
interested also, and historians claim he was the first German to
build near Massanutten Mountain.</p>

<p>His neighbors were Abram Strickler, Mathias Selser, Phillip
Long, Paul Long, Michael Rinehart, and Jonathan Rood. Some
give the date of this settlement as early as 1726. Adam Miller
took out his naturalization papers a few years later and today, the
visitor may read the quaint document hanging on the walls of
the Miller home, near Elkton, Virginia.</p>

<p>His log cabin was soon outgrown. He was a good farmer and
his wife and sister helped him. His crops were larger each year.
Besides, Adam was a business man. He secured a large land grant
and he soon was selling off farms to other Germans who came
from Pennsylvania and from Germany.</p>

<p>The Millers built a larger home and they bought some good
sturdy furniture to replace the crude tables and chairs which were
home-made. They took pleasure in getting the home all ready
before they moved into it. They had even spread the beds with
the new hand-woven coverlets which his wife and sister had made
during the long winter nights. The next night they would sleep
in their new home. But during the night, a fire broke out&mdash;no
one ever knew its origin&mdash;and everything was destroyed before
the family woke up!</p>

<p>The Millers were undaunted, so they built again. We are
told what good neighbors there were in those days. The men
took their own axes and cut down the trees. They dressed the
lumber, sawed the timbers by careful measurements, laid foundations,
and built chimneys. It did not take so long to build
a house. The visitor today will see a big white house on the
road between Luray and Elkton, almost beneath the shadow
of old Massanutten Mountain. He will see the marker which
tells him that this house was built by the Miller family. Inside,
the visitor will see priceless early American furniture. He will
see rosewood and later Empire furniture, too, as other generations
added to their heritage. But when one goes into the log
cabin kitchen he will stand in reverence before a collection of
early Dutch tables, chairs, platters, plates of Delft and pewter,
spoons of the same ware. There is a huge corner cupboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
which everyone would like to have for his own. This house no
longer has a direct descendant of Adam and his good wife to
occupy it, for the last one of his line recently died.</p>

<p>Adam Miller was not only a good neighbor to his German
friends but we are told they did not have much trouble with the
Indians during the first years he lived in the Valley. However, he
was a brave fighter during the Indian Wars and his record is
given in <i>Henning's Statutes</i>. He lived through most of the Revolutionary
War and no doubt longed to fight in behalf of the
country which had given him the opportunity to develop it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On Sunday evening, Dec. 3rd, 1749 a young Franciscan went with
us (<i>Diary of Leonard Schell, a Moravian Missionary</i>) to show us the
way to Mathias Schawb, who immediately on my offer to preach for
them, sent messengers to announce my sermon. In a short time a
considerable number of people assembled to whom I preached. After
the sermon I baptised a child of Holland's. We stayed overnight
with Mathias Schawb. His wife told us we were always welcome and
we must come to them whenever we came into that district.</p>

<p>"Toward evening a man from another Dutch settlement, Adam
Miller passed. I told him that I would like to come to his house and
preach there. He asked if I were sent by God and I answered yes.
He said if I were sent by God I should be welcome, but he said there
are at present so many kinds of people that often one does not know
where they come from. I requested him to notify his neighbors that
I would preach which he did.</p>

<p>"On Dec. 4th we left Schawb's house commending the whole family
to God. We travelled through the rain across the South Shenandoah
to Adam Miller's house who received us with much love. We stayed
over night.</p>

<p>"On Dec. 5th I preached at Adam Miller's house on 'Whosoever
thirsteth let him come to the water and drink.' A number of thirsty
souls were present. Especially Adam Miller took in every word and
after the sermon declared himself well pleased. In the afternoon we
travelled a short distance, staying overnight with a Swiss."</p></div>

<h2><a name="Joist_Hite_the_Pioneer" id="Joist_Hite_the_Pioneer"></a>Joist Hite, the Pioneer</h2>


<p>When Joist Hite arrived in Virginia he and his family were
required to settle on the land bought from the VanMeters. His
purchase was made in June 1731. In October of the same year, he
and Robert McKay obtained a grant from the Colonial Govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>ment
to have 100,000 acres of land surveyed on the west side of
the mountain, with the agreement to bring in one hundred
settlers within two years. During that year, Hite moved in and
settled on that land, but he got an extension of time for bringing
in other settlers. By Christmas of 1735 Hite had brought in fifty-four
families.</p>

<p>All this land was in the County of Spotsylvania and Hite found
that he and his brothers were too far away from the courts so he
became interested in getting a new county organized in 1734.
This was named Orange, in honor of the Duke of Orange. Later
on, having acquired more land, he found himself again too far
removed from a court house. And again he applied for a new
county. In fact he needed two counties for all his lands and ever-increasing
settlers. In 1738 Orange County was divided into
three counties, namely: Orange, Frederick, and Augusta to the
west of the mountain. With Joist Hite and his wife Anna Maria
came their daughters, Mary, her husband George Bowman, Elizabeth
and her husband Paul Froman, Magadelena and her husband
Jacob Chrisman, and their sons John, Jacob, Isaac, Abraham and
Joseph. Hite, we are told, allowed his sons-in-law to choose
their own homesteads.</p>

<p>His wife, Anna Maria, died in 1738 at Long Meadows and
soon he married again. We read the following quaint marriage
contracts between him and his second wife:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the Name of Jesus</p>

<p>"Whereas, we, two persons, I, Joist Hite and Maria Magadelena,
Relict and Widow of Christian Nuschanger, according to God's holy
ordinance and the knowledge and consent of our Friends and Children
and Relations are going to enter into the holy state of Matrimony.
We have made this Nuptial part one with the others. First promise
to the aforesaid Maria Magadalena all the Christian Love and Faithfulness.
Secondly, as neither of us are a moment secure from death
so I promise her Home or Widow Seat so long as she lives and the
Heir to whom the said House shall fall shall provide the necessary
Diet and Cloathes and if that do not please but that she rather
desire to have her commendations in any other place, so shall the
foresaid Heir to the House yearly pay her Six Pounds ready money
and this is my well considered desire.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="rpos">"<span class="smcap">Joist Hite.</span>"</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And Likewise wife, I Maria Magadalena promise the aforesaid Joist
Hite. First of all, Love and Obedience. Secondly, I am designed to
bring with me to him some cattle, money, household goods which in
agreement with attested witnesses shall be Described and should I die
before the said Hite so shall the said Hite have the half thereof and
the other half shall be delivered back again to my heirs and this is
also my well considered desire. Thirdly and Lastly, whoever of the
aforesaid persons shall die first the half of the portion the Woman
brings with her shall go back to her heirs."</p></div>

<p>The following goods were brought by the said Mary Magadelena
to Joist Hite:</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p style="text-indent: -1.25em;">"1 In ready money, twenty two pounds seventeen Shillings and
four pence.</p>

<p>2 Two mares one colt value of fourteen pounds.</p>

<p>3 Two drawing steers value three pounds, ten shillings.</p>

<p>4 Two coarse beds Cloathes in all three pounds, Sixteen Shillings
and six pence. And said money is adjudged to be in Virginia
Currency the 16th day of November, 1741, also one horse mare,
six pounds."</p></div>

<p>Another neighbor pioneering in the Valley was Jacob Stover
who secured land grants. History records that he resorted to
unusual methods in obtaining them. Upon application, it was
necessary to convince the authorities that the applicant could
furnish a sufficient number of families to settle the land requested.
Stover did not have the required number. He took himself to
England to petition the King and in order to be convincing he
gave names to every living thing he possessed&mdash;dogs, sheep,
horses, cows and pigs! After his successful trip which resulted in
receiving the land grant, he commenced selling small acreages
to the new-comers. He enriched himself materially, but incurred
the wrath of his associates.</p>

<h2><a name="German_Neighbors" id="German_Neighbors"></a>German Neighbors</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Quakers</span></h3>


<p>Long ago, a shrewd trader from New York, John VanMeter,
came into the Valley. He made friends with the Delawares and
often went with them on their hunting trips. Once he even
fought on their side against their enemies, the Catawbas. While
on this visit South, he saw for the first time the fertile native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
grass, which grew "five or six feet high", in the Valley. When
he returned to New York he told his sons about the rich country,
far to the South, and advised them to secure some of it. One of
them, Isaac, took his father's advice and came to Virginia in
1736-7 and with a tomahawk cut certain trees, thus making his
original claim. This was called the "Tomakawk Right".</p>

<p>Isaac and his brother John secured a warrant from Governor
Gooch for forty thousand acres of land. Later on they sold or
transferred part of their grant to Joist Hite who was later called
the "Old Baron". The latter was one of the hardiest pioneers
and in 1734 was appointed by the Virginia Council to act as
magistrate. This gave him authority to settle disputes, and to
uphold the laws of Virginia as well as to punish all offenders.</p>

<p>Hite soon built a stone house on Opequon Creek and his sons and
daughters grew to be splendid men and women. His sons-in-law,
George Bowman, Jacob Chrisman and Paul Froman and their
families had come with him from Pennsylvania. Robert McKay,
Robert Green, William Duff, Peter Stevens and several other
families helped each other select land, build homes and a fort.</p>

<p>We are told that the Indians had heard of the kindly relations
which existed between the Indians and William Penn's colonists.
We know he paid the Indians for their lands, and records show
that many of the Germans, especially the Quakers, who settled on
Apple Pie Ridge also bought lands from the Indians. These
settlers were never disturbed by the Indians. However, when it
came to the lands which we now call the Great Valley of Virginia,
the Indians were agreed among themselves that no one tribe was
to possess any of it. The lands were so fertile and so much game
feasted there, that all should be at peace when in the Valley.</p>

<p>So when the first Quakers came we find these names recorded:
the Neills, Walkers, Bransons, McKays, Hackneys, Beesoms,
Luptons, Barretts, Dillons and Fawcetts.</p>

<p>Another Quaker, Ross, obtained a warrant for surveying lands
and his lines were run along the Opequon, north of Winchester,
and up to Apple Pie Ridge. Soon many other Quakers from
Pennsylvania were moving into the Valley to settle on Ross's
surveys. By 1738 these deeply religious people had built homes
and were holding monthly meetings to worship God. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
tiny settlements up and down the Valley. They cultivated their
farms, took little interest in politics, cared very little for worldly
intercourse and made excellent neighbors. Their manners and
dress were plain, their furniture only what was necessary, their
homes were crude, but their barns were large and their cattle were
well protected.</p>

<p>They refused to pay taxes during the Revolutionary War or to
bear arms. Then their neighbors began to ridicule them, calling
them cowards, and were no longer friendly. Officers came and
seized their crops or property and sold them to raise funds with
which to carry on the War against England. The Legislature
enacted a law whereby a Quaker either had to fight or pay a
substitute to fight for him. Their personal property was put
under the hammer and soon they were reduced to poverty.
One incident will give us a picture of those far-off days. James
Gotharp lived with his neighbors on Apple Pie Ridge. One day
during the Revolutionary War officers came, demanding that he
should march away with them to join the militia; he refused.
The men forced him to come along and later he was made a
guard. He was placed beside a baggage wagon and told to let
no man go into the wagon who did not have a written order from
the commanding officer. Along came an officer who started to
climb into the vehicle. James called to him and demanded to see
his order of authority. The officer cursed him and stepped up to
climb in. James caught him by his legs and pulled his feet
off the step. This caused the officer to fall, striking his face
against the wagon, bruising his nose and mouth severely.</p>

<p>The dress of the Quakers is still picturesque and many are to
be seen in certain sections of the Valley. They wear a broad
brimmed hat, a long frock coat, generally black. The women
wear full skirts, down to their ankles, black hose, plain black
shoes, with round toes. Their bodices, usually black or gray in
color, are severely cut, with long plain sleeves, with a high neck,
relieved by a white collar. They usually wear a small cap, made
of the same material as their dress.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dunkards</span></h3>

<p>Lending an air of uniqueness yet to the Valley towns is that
religious sect called Dunkards. One sees the women of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
denomination, with their little black bonnets, on almost any
street in any town along the Lee Highway.</p>

<p>At one time the sect was called Tunkers. They are an offshoot
of the Seventh-Day Baptists and had their beginnings in the
Valley a little after 1732.</p>

<p>When Dr. Thomas Walker passed through the section on his
way westward he noted in his journal on March 17th, 1750, "The
Dunkards are an odd set of people, who make it a matter of
religion not to Shave their Beards, ly on Beds, or eat Flesh though
at present, in the last, they transgress, being constrained to it, as
they say, by the want of a sufficiency of Grain and Roots, they
having not long been seated here. I doubt the plenty and deliciousness
of the Venison and Turkeys has contributed not a little
to this. The unmarried have no private Property, but live on a
common Stock. They don't baptize either Young or Old, they
keep their Sabbath on Saturday, and hold that all men shall be
happy hereafter, but first must pass through punishment according
to their Sins. They are very hospitable."</p>

<p>The Dunkards built a part of their faith around their disapproval
of violence, even for self-defense, and their submission
to fraud or wrongdoing rather than resorting to court trials.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Scotch-Irish_in_the_Valley" id="The_Scotch-Irish_in_the_Valley"></a>The Scotch-Irish in the Valley</h2>


<p>Many reasons caused the people of Europe to emigrate during
the eighteenth century. In Ireland and Scotland an unrest was
spreading as seen in the story of John Lewis.</p>

<p>He was born in Ireland and was a thrifty gentleman. He fell
in love with and married Margaret Lynn, daughter of the laird of
Loch Lynn, a descendant of a powerful Scotch clan. They were
very happy with their three little sons and soon John Lewis rented
more lands from a landlord. These lands brought him more and
more wealth and the landlord grew jealous. He told Lewis that
he would not let him continue to cultivate them, although the
lease was not expired.</p>

<p>One day the landlord came to the Lewis home. He brought
many of his hirelings and demanded that Lewis vacate the house
at once. At the time, Lewis' brother was ill and could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
help him defend his home. Margaret, his wife, and a few
servants quickly barred the doors and windows and defied the
landlord to enter.</p>

<p>The infuriated man began to fire into the house and one shot
killed John Lewis' brother and one wounded Margaret. John
could not stand such an outrage any longer, so he rushed out and
in the fight which followed, he killed the landlord.</p>

<p>His family and neighbors, knowing the influential Irish would
not give him a fair trial, urged him to flee the country. At last
he consented to go, but before he did, he carefully wrote down
all the details of the trouble and sent it to the proper authorities.
Then he hastily left the country and soon was on his way to
Virginia. Lewis went to Williamsburg after landing in Virginia.
There he met a weaver, Salling, who told him some of the
wildest stories he had ever heard.</p>

<p>The weaver had known a peddler, named Marlin, who took his
pack far into the land beyond the mountains and traded his pewter
ware, beads, compasses and other small articles to the Indians
for furs. He told Salling such marvelous stories of the Indians
and country that the weaver asked to let him go on one of his
trips with him. This he did, and the weaver had plenty of
adventures before he finally got back to Williamsburg.</p>

<p>The two men reached the Valley and were far beyond the
Blue Ridge Mountains when the Cherokee Indians, thinking they
were spies, took them prisoners. Marlin had the good fortune
to get away, but Salling was carried farther across another mountain
range into what is now Kentucky, where the Indians went to
hunt buffalo. Here the Cherokees were attacked by their enemies
from Illinois. Salling was again captured and carried off to the
southwest. He was adopted by an old Indian squaw as her son
and for some time he lived with her. At last a Spaniard bought
him and took him as an interpreter to Canada. There he met
the French Governor who sent him to New York and after six
years, he at last reached Williamsburg.</p>

<p>You would think Salling after this would have settled down
and become a weaver again. But life was too tame. When
Lewis asked him about the lands in the Valley, Salling decided
to take him and the Englishman, John Mackay, who also wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to go. Lewis found the country all that Salling had promised
him and he decided to settle on a creek which bears his name
today.</p>

<p>He obtained authority to 100,000 acres of land in and near
the ground on which he built his fort-like house. Before very
long, many of his friends and neighbors from Ireland were on
their way to Virginia to join him. Many of them settled in
Western Augusta near Fort Lewis. One can imagine how happy
it made John Lewis to be told that the authorities, upon investigation,
had granted him a pardon and absolved him from all
blame in the killing of his landlord before he left Ireland. These
Scotch-Irish, like their German neighbors, did not have very
much trouble from the Indians for several years.</p>

<p>Thomas, a son of John Lewis, studied and went to represent
his county in the House of Burgesses. He was a man of sound
judgment and voted for Patrick Henry's celebrated resolutions.</p>

<p>Andrew, another son, was a soldier, and made his home in
Botetourt County. During the Indian Wars, he was made a
General but not until he had proved his worth in many a battle.
He served with George Washington on July 4th, 1754 when Fort
Necessity was taken, and he was present when the articles of the
treaty were agreed upon. When Washington was made Commander-in-Chief,
it is said he asked Lewis to accept the commission
of brigadier-general. In 1776 he commanded the Virginians
when Governor Dunnmore was driven from Gwynn's
Island and we are told he gave the order for attacking the enemy
and he himself lighted the match to the eighteen-pounder.</p>

<p>General Lewis resigned in 1780 and on his way home was
taken ill with fever. He died near Bedford, about forty miles
from home.</p>

<p>We cannot give all the accounts of William, Andrew and
Charles, the other sons, but if one would read interesting captures
and escapes from Indians, he will find that of Charles most
exciting.</p>

<p>The sons of John and Margaret Lynn Lewis helped to develop
the Valley of Virginia and their name is an honored one wherever
it is found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Indians" id="Indians"></a>Indians</h2>


<p>Early historians give us some accounts of the various Indians
in Virginia. Opechancanough, a warrior chief from the East, went
to war with Sherando, a member of the Iroquois tribe. Opechancanough
in crossing the mountains on a foraging expedition was
once attacked by Sherando who felt his tribe should not have to
share its hunting grounds with anyone else and resented the
invasion. A fierce battle took place, with no one victor.</p>

<p>Opechancanough liked the country, so when he returned to his
town below Williamsburg on the Chickahominy, he left his son
and a few warriors to watch the hunting grounds which he had
found so rich in game. This son, Shee-wa-a-nee, with his band
soon had to fight the main body of the Iroquois and Sherando
drove the Chief east of the mountains.</p>

<p>Opechancanough left the lowlands as soon as the news was
brought to him by runners. He gathered his warriors and set off
with a large force. He fell upon Sherando and in the fierce battles
which followed, he slowly drove him from his grounds, and he
never returned from his home near the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>Sheewa-a-nee was left again in charge of the Hunting Grounds
and from that day the Shawnees held the lovely Valley until the
coming of the white settlers.</p>

<p>The settlers kept many of the Indian names for both mountains
and streams. Opechancanough river was so called for the Great
Chief. Legend and history tell us that in his later years he
became blind and could no longer hunt in the lovely Shenandoah
Valley.</p>

<p>There were many tribes of Indians in the country and though
they did not all speak the same language, they did have a common
tongue and could understand each other.</p>

<p>After 1710 all the lands west of the Blue Ridge Mountains
were spoken of as Indian Country. The different tribes evidently
had understanding among themselves about certain boundary
lines as individual tribes had certain domains. When one violated
these rights, there was a war in which whole tribes sometimes
would be completely wiped out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The Shawnees, the most powerful and warlike of all, claimed
all the hunting grounds west of the Blue Ridge and as far west
across the Alleghany as the Mississippi. They had three large
towns in the Valley. One was near where Winchester stands
today, one on the North River in Shenandoah County, and one
on the South Branch, near where Moorefield is situated. They
did allow other tribes to visit them in the Valley on condition
they pay them tribute in skins or loot.</p>

<p>The next tribe was the Tuscaroras, and they spent most of
their time in what is now West Virginia.</p>

<p>Another tribe was an offshoot from the Sherandos and were
called Senedos. They were completely wiped out by the fierce
tribe of Cherokees from the South, in 1732.</p>

<p>The Catawbas were from South Carolina and had their towns
along the river which still bears that name.</p>

<p>The Delawares came from Pennsylvania and their villages were
along the Susquehanna River. The Susquenoughs were a large
and friendly tribe on the Chesapeake Bay and they were good to
the white settlers until their enemies, the Cenela tribes, drove
them away from Tidewater Virginia. Then they went to the
upper Potomac River. The Cenelas soon followed them to the
same region. Another tribe, the Piscataway, lived along the
headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>The Cherokees had their villages on the Tennessee River down
in the Carolinas and Georgia and Alabama. This tribe was made
up of the nations of the South, the Muscogluges, the Seminoles,
Chickasaws, Choctaws and Creeks. At certain times, all these
Indians made forages into the Valley. Besides these there were
those from New York&mdash;the Senecas, Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas
and Cayugas. These were called the Five Nations and
they too claimed the right to hunt in the Valley. These Indians
believed, we are told, that the Great Spirit had given this Valley
to all Indians and it is not surprising that they resented the
coming of the white men who soon began to build homes, barns
and fences and who claimed the right to shoot the Indians if they
came on their property.</p>

<p>Then the French about this time began to build forts along the
St. Lawrence River, the Great Lakes and on down the Mississippi
River to the Gulf of Mexico. The French made every effort to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
make friends with the Indians and told them the British had no
right to take their lands. The French said they would protect
their rights if the Indians would let them. Consequently, they
became allies of the French and they began to move their villages
and towns toward the French lines. They continued to keep a
part of their homes and to send back bands of hunters to look
after the hunting grounds beyond the mountains.</p>

<p>If the Indians had not been friendly to those pioneers who
dared to build homes in the Valley, there would not have been
any civilization there until a much later date. But as we have
seen, many of them came from Pennsylvania where William Penn
and his colonists had dealt so fairly with the Indians. Naturally
then, the Indians thought all the settlers would be like those.
Besides, there were so few of them, they did not at first realize
that their hunting grounds were being taken from them. Consequently,
the Delawares and Catawbas in hunting did no harm,
though they were bitter enemies and the settlers often saw them
with prisoners from the other tribes.</p>

<p>There were Indian villages on the Potomac and on both
branches of the Shenandoah. Numerous Indian mounds and
graves are still to be seen in certain sections of the Valley. Many
of these have been opened and skeletons found to be in a wonderful
state of preservation; utensils, pipes, axes, tomahawks, pots
and hominy pestles have been found. Their pots and utensils
were made of a mixture of clay and hard shells, very crude as to
workmanship but very strong.</p>

<p>After twenty or more years of comparative peace, the Indians
suddenly left the Valley. In 1753 messengers came from the
Western Indians into the Valley and invited them to cross the
Alleghany mountains. Historians claim this was done through
the influence of the French and later consequences seem to
establish the point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Indian_Tales" id="Indian_Tales"></a>Indian Tales</h2>


<p>In the year 1774 the Indians began to give serious trouble to
the settlers on New River. One day several children, those of
the Lybrooks' and the Snydow's, were playing down by the river.
They heard a dog barking and upon looking up, saw some Indians
approaching. One of the boys ran along the edge of the stream
trying to make his escape and warn the family. But one of the
Indians ran ahead and cut off that means of escape. He also fired
at two boys who were farther out in the stream, but fortunately
missed them.</p>

<p>While the Indian was aiming at the boys, one of them ran up a
rough path which had been made by the animals as they went back
and forth to drink. The boy scrambled up this path and darted by
the Indian who tried his best to catch him. The Indian gave
pursuit and the boy ran until he came to a wide gulley about ten
feet wide. This the boy easily jumped, but the Indian hesitated
and threw a buffalo tug which struck his head and hurt his back.
But he never stopped running until he reached his father's home
and slipped into the fort where he told the parents of the attack.</p>

<p>In the meantime, five of the children who were playing in the
river climbed into the canoe. The Indians waded out, then
swimming to the side of it, pulled out the children, killed them,
and took their scalps.</p>

<p>An older girl, about thirteen years old, turned over the canoe
and swam downstream, then jumped to the opposite bank. One
of the Indians pursued her and she screamed loudly for help.
A faithful guard dog came to her rescue and as the Indian
reached out to grab her, the dog jumped at the Indian, tearing
the flesh in his thigh, and threw him down. This gave the girl
time to make her escape.</p>

<p>The Indian struck the dog a blow with his club which finally
made him let up on the man. The faithful dog went to the
canoe and stood guard over the five scalped children until their
people came to take them away for burial. Then the dog refused
to leave the spot and began to howl in a most pitiful way. He
ran into the woods and back again, keeping up his cries until one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of the men followed him to see what was troubling him. There
near a tree, he found a little boy of six years, bleeding to death
from a scalp wound.</p>

<p>In 1760 two Indians were seen hiding around Mill Creek.
Mr. Painter, his brother John and William Moore went in
search of them. After some time they came to a newly fallen
pine tree which had a very bushy top.</p>

<p>"We had better be careful," Mathias Painter said as they
neared the fallen tree. "There may be Indians hidden in it."
As he spoke, an Indian fired from the tree. His bullet grazed
John's temple not injuring him. Then the other two white men
fired at the Indians, striking one of them who fell to the ground.
They supposed him to be dead, so they pursued the one who had
fled, leaving his gun and loot behind him.</p>

<p>But the Indian was strong and he outran the two men.
Imagine their surprise when they returned, and found the Indian
gone whom they had supposed dead, taking the guns and pack
of skins with him. The white men picked up his trail and followed
him. He hid himself in a sink-hole and when the men
came near he opened fire on them. He poured out his powder on
the dry grass in front of him so he could reload his gun more
quickly. He fired at least thirty times before the two men finally
were able to kill him.</p>

<p>The Indian who had gotten away met a young woman of the
neighborhood who was riding horseback. He tore her from the
horse and forced her to go with him. This happened near where
New Market stands today. They travelled about twenty miles or
more. The Indian became impatient because she complained of
being so tired. People near Keesleton heard cries in the night.
The next day when they went to see who had made them, they
found a pine knot on which blood was still fresh. Nearby, they
found the poor girl, already dead from the cruel blows and from
loss of blood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="The_Moore_Massacre" id="The_Moore_Massacre"></a>The Moore Massacre</h2>


<p>One of the most beautiful sections in Southwestern Virginia is
called Ab's Valley, in Tazewell County. It was first settled by
Captain James Moore, one of the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, who
had moved from Rockingham County in 1775. There was no
river running through the ten miles of fertile grounds, but several
springs watered the tall grass which afforded fine grazing for
stock and game. Captain Moore's brother-in-law, Mr. Robert
Poage, came to live nearby, but they were the only settlers in
that neighborhood. Their nearest neighbors and a fort were over
twelve miles away.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1782 the Indians came to Mr. Poage's house
and burst through the heavy door without any warning. They
did not expect to find any men there and when they saw there
were three they did not attempt to enter the house. The next
morning, a man named Richardson, who worked on the place,
went out to look at some deer skins which he had soaking in a
nearby pond. The Indians crept up and shot him, taking his scalp.</p>

<p>Two years passed before the Indians attacked the Moore family.
James, a young boy of fourteen, was sent by Captain Moore to
get some horses from a field about two miles from his home.
He wanted James to go to the mill and for this he needed an
extra horse.</p>

<p>James had gone only a short distance when three Indians
sprang from behind a log and caught hold of the boy. He
screamed and the Indian laid his hand over his mouth and in
the Indian language told him to keep still.</p>

<p>Black Wolf was the name of the middle-aged Indian. His son
was about eighteen years old. The other Indian seemed to be one
of Black Wolf's men. James said he was not so very much
frightened after he was told he belonged to Black Wolf, though
he was one of the sternest looking men he had ever seen. Black
Wolf gave James some salt and told him to catch some of his
father's horses for him. James said he would, meaning he would
catch two, and try to make his escape on one of them. But every
time he caught a horse the Indians ran up and frightened it so
it would get away. At last the Indians gathered up their blankets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and pots where they were hidden in the grass and motioned for
James to fall in line. The young Indian went first, then the
Indian man, then James, followed by Black Wolf.</p>

<p>James tried to break off pieces of bushes so his father could
tell which way he had gone. Black Wolf tapped his shoulder and
shook his head. Then he tried to leave signs by digging his toes
down into the soft earth. Again Black Wolf shook his head.</p>

<p>After they had gone a long way, about sundown Black Wolf
gave a long war-whoop. He did the same the next morning at
sunrise. The Indians did this to show they had a prisoner. They
gave one cry for each prisoner taken. If they had taken scalps,
the cry would have been a different kind.</p>

<p>Before they lay down in the thicket that night, Black Wolf
searched James to see if he carried a knife. Then he took out a
halter and tied it fast to James' neck and wrapped the other end
around his hand.</p>

<p>The next morning Black Wolf left James with the other two
Indians and went off to get a Dutch oven which he had taken on
one of his other expeditions. He gave this to James to carry.
He fastened it to James' back, but after it rubbed a sore place,
James threw it down and refused to carry it further. Black Wolf
then took off the huge bundle which he carried and told James to
take it. But he could not even lift it from the ground. The
Indian then pointed to the Dutch oven, and he found it was not
so bad to carry after he padded it with leaves.</p>

<p>He found out how long the Indians could go without much
food. For three whole days they had only water in which poplar
bark had been steeped. On the fourth day they shot a buffalo.
They took a small bit of the meat and made a clear broth which
they drank but Black Wolf did not let them eat any of the meat
until the next day, this being their custom after fasting.</p>

<p>James said he travelled the whole way barefooted. Of course
his feet became sore from bruises. He saw many rattlesnakes,
but he was not allowed to kill them as the Indians considered
them to be their friends.</p>

<p>James knew that the Shawnees, of whom Black Wolf was a member,
lived far to the West. He believed they must be nearing their
town after he had travelled for twenty days. He told of how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
made a raft of logs on which they crossed the Ohio and other
streams. He learned how to twine the long grapevines around the
logs to make the raft. He saw how the Indians made crude pictures
in the banks of the streams to let other Indians know they had a
prisoner. Black Wolf stopped and drew three Indians and a boy.</p>

<p>When the Indians came near their town they painted themselves
black. They left him white as an omen of safety. Black
Wolf traded James to his half-sister for a horse. James later found
out why he was not taken into the town. It was a time of
peace and if they had seen the new prisoner, they might have
made him run the gauntlet. The old squaw was kind to him
and sometimes left him alone in the wigwam for days at a time.
He said he prayed to God to keep him safe. We cannot give all
his experiences with the Indians, but he was finally sold to a
French trader from Detroit. His name was Baptist Ariome and
he liked James, for he looked like his own son. He gave the old
squaw fifty dollars' worth of silver brooches, beads, and other
trinkets in Indian money.</p>

<p>James met a man who was a trader from Kentucky, a Mr.
Sherlock. This man promised to write to James' father and
tell him of his capture, of his being sold and of his being taken
to Detroit. After some time, as we shall see, he did get back to
Virginia.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, many other things were happening to the
Moore family. In July 1786, several of the hundred head of
horses which belonged to Captain Moore came in to the salt block
to get salt. Captain Moore went out to see them, about two hundred
yards from the house. Nearby were two of his children,
William and Rebecca, who were coming from the spring; not far
away was another child, Alexander. All at once a stream of bullets
began to fly. Thirty Indians had hidden themselves in the tall
grass which almost surrounded the Moore home. William and
Rebecca were killed instantly. Captain Moore ran to the fence
which separated the lot from the house and as he climbed over, he
was struck by several bullets. The Indians then ran up and
scalped him.</p>

<p>Two men who lived with the Moores were not far away in a
field, reaping wheat. When they heard the shooting they ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
toward the house but when they saw it was surrounded by
Indians they made their escape and went off to give the alarm
to other settlers who were six miles away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore and Martha Evans, the girl in the house with her,
quickly barred the door when they saw the tragedy. They took
down the rifles which had been fired the night before and gave
them to an old Englishman, John Simpson, who was ill, to load
for them. But the old man could not help them, for he had been
struck by a bullet as he lay sick.</p>

<p>Martha Evans soon decided to hide under a loose board in the
floor of the cabin. Polly Moore, a little girl of eight, was holding
her baby sister who was screaming with fear. Martha told Polly
to get under the board too, but she decided to stay with the baby.</p>

<p>Then the Indians burst down the door and lunged in. They
took Mrs. Moore prisoner and four children, John, Polly, Jane,
and Peggy. They took everything they fancied, then set the house
on fire.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Moore saw the Indians kill her son because he
was sick and could not keep up with them. They killed the
baby because it cried so pitiously. They had to have their hands
tied, as had James, and they, too, fasted.</p>

<p>When at last they reached the Indian town, Mrs. Moore and
Jane were killed by torture and death at the stake. Polly was
treated more kindly and was finally sold to a man near Lake Erie,
for a half gallon of rum!</p>

<p>Now fate seems to have taken a hand in bringing Polly and
her brother James together in that far-away country. While on a
hunting expedition James heard about the destruction of his
family. He was told that his sister Polly had been bought by a
Mr. Stogwell, a man of bad character. It was in the Winter, so
James waited until Spring when Mr. Stogwell moved into the
same section of the country where he was living.</p>

<p>When James went to see them he found Polly very miserable.
Her clothing was only rags and she had almost lost hope of
ever seeing any of her people again. James found that Mr.
Stogwell was unkind, too, so he went with Simon Girty to
Colonel McKee, Superintendent of Indians, to get her release.
He had Mr. Stogwell brought to trial, but they did not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
enough evidence and Polly could not leave him. However, after
much trouble, James was able to get passage for Polly and
himself on a trading boat and came down the Great Lakes. They
landed in a Moravian town where they met some friends owning
horses. They journeyed to Pittsburgh and stayed until Spring.
Then they set off for Virginia, sad, of course, knowing how
few there would be to welcome them. Yet they were delighted
to find their brother Joseph was still safe. He had been visiting
his grandfather in Rockbridge County at the time of the massacre.</p>

<p>Polly met and married the <a name="corr_2"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: Reverened">Reverend</ins> Samuel Brown, a Presbyterian
preacher. They had seven sons, and five of them were
ministers.</p>

<h2><a name="Washingtons_Boyhood_Friend" id="Washingtons_Boyhood_Friend"></a>Washington's Boyhood Friend&mdash;Lord Fairfax</h2>


<p>"The Proprietor of the Northern Neck," Lord Fairfax, lived at
"Greenway Court" after first having a country seat at Belvoir near
the Potomac River in what is now Fairfax County.</p>

<p>An interesting character this Fairfax must have been. Born
with a title in England, he moved in intellectual circles there, was
acquainted with men of letters such as Addison and actually
contributed some articles to the <i>Spectator</i>. Either through boredom
or a disappointment in not winning the lady of his choice
he decided to leave his country and come to Virginia.</p>

<p>It may be of passing interest to learn that Lord Fairfax, although
proprietor of thousands upon thousands of acres, lived in
a comparatively simple way. His home was an unpretentious
story and a half frame building, situated in a large grove of trees,
and surrounded by smaller homes for servants and tenants.
"Greenway Court," the name given the home, very probably
lacked more indications of elegance and grace because of Fairfax's
bachelor state.</p>

<p>A mile from the house he had erected a white-oak post which
served as guide for those in search of his dwelling. At White
Post, the village which derived its name from the signpost, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
may see a replica of the original, located on the site of the first
one placed there in 1760 by the proprietor.</p>

<p>His domain, called the "Northern Neck of Virginia," comprised
the present counties of Lancaster, Northumberland, Richmond,
Westmoreland, Stafford, King George, Prince William, Fairfax,
Loudon, Fauquier, Culpeper, Clarke, Madison and Page in Virginia
and numerous counties in West Virginia.</p>

<p>Lord Fairfax was exceptionally interested in fox hunting and
reserved great tracts for this sport. Sometimes he spent weeks
at a time hunting. He made a rule that whoever caught the fox
should cut off its tail and hold it aloft and should have no part
of the expense of the subsequent frolic. As soon as a fox was
started all the young men would gallop off at a great rate, while
Fairfax waited behind with a servant familiar with the hills and
streams and who had a good ear; following the servant's directions
he frequently stuck the fox's tail in his hat and rejoined the
hunters!</p>

<p>Familiar to everyone is the fact that Lord Fairfax engaged
Washington, a boy of about sixteen, to survey his vast lands
beyond the Blue Ridge. Through this undertaking the latter
gained a thorough knowledge of frontier life and a reputation
for dependability and self-confidence. These attributes were to
be needed later for participation in the French and Indian War.
A warm and lasting friendship grew up between the proprietor
and Washington.</p>

<p>Being British by birth and sympathy the course of the Revolution
was watched with mingled hopes and anxieties by Fairfax.
When news of the final capitulation at Yorktown arrived late in
October 1781 the feeble, disappointed and tired old man called
his servant and asked to be put to bed since he felt the time had
come for him to die. In December of that same year the great
proprietor of the Northern Neck of Virginia died.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Winchester" id="Winchester"></a>Winchester&mdash;The Frontier Town of the Valley</h2>


<p>The first inhabitants of Winchester were a large tribe of
Shawnee Indians. Two houses occupied by white men are supposed
to have been standing as early as 1738.</p>

<p>Known as Old Town and Fredericktown it was named Winchester
in 1752 in honor of the English home of its founder,
Colonel James Wood. The settlement grew so rapidly it was
necessary several times to enlarge its boundaries. Colonel Wood
and Lord Fairfax both donated additional lots in order to extend
the corporate limits of the town.</p>

<p>During the French and Indian War Colonel George Washington
was asked to go to Winchester to defend the Valley. He
found refugees overrunning the place and determined to build
a fort on the outskirts of the town which would afford protection
in case of raids. He imported his own blacksmith to do the
foundry work, so anxious was he to speed the construction of
the fortifications. Fort Loudon was the name given, after Lord
Loudon the commander of the colonial forces, and a successful
defense was made against the French there. It may be of interest
to learn that the fort's bastion still remains and the well
which supplied water during the French and Indian War is still
in use today.</p>

<p>No account of Winchester would be complete if the story of
General Daniel Morgan were omitted. Of Scotch-Irish extraction
he came with his parents from New Jersey to the new settlement.
As a youngster he was considered something of a bully. The
story goes that around "Battletown," an intersection in the roads
where toughs used to fight for the joy of combat, young Morgan
was in the habit of placing large stones at strategic points. In
case he had to retreat he was able to draw on this supply of
ammunition!</p>

<p>Tradition has it that on one occasion young Dan Morgan had
just arrived in Winchester from the Western settlements on the
South Branch&mdash;as a driver of a pack for the fur traders. George
Washington was ready with his small party to go to the Ohio
Country with a message to the French officials not to continue
their fort building on English property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>Washington's journal gives the following notes: "On Ye 17th
day of Ye month of Novemo,&mdash;the party consists of one guide
and packer, one Indian interpreter, one French interpreter and
four gentlemen." We know now that the celebrated Gist was his
guide and Vanbraam his interpreter. It is said that Morgan
offered his services too as a guide, and was accepted. It was on
this perilous trip, perhaps, that each of these young men realized
the fine traits of the other.</p>

<p>It was Daniel Morgan who, at the outbreak of the Revolution,
marched a hundred men with one wagon of supplies to Boston
to report to General Washington. He fought at Quebec and
Saratoga and defeated Tarleton at Cowpens. He had charge of
Hessian prisoners captured at Saratoga and there are evidences
yet of his supervision of construction of stone walls and homes
and the mill at Millwood built with prisoner labor.</p>

<p>"Saratoga" is the name he gave his home near Boyce; it was
built mainly by the Hessian artisans. On his way to Gettysburg
in 1863 General Lee used the fine old house as headquarters.
This estate is on the road between Winchester and Boyce and is
in full view of the highway.</p>

<p>There is a wealth of amusing tales told about the old city,
some dating as far back as its conception; others have to do with
the activities of later times.</p>

<p>The story is still heard in Winchester of the time when guests
and village loafers were congregated in one of the taverns at the
close of a day to discuss weighty topics over their glasses of ale.
From a window they saw an old man get out of his gig, taking
with him luggage for overnight accommodation. The gig was
comparable to the famed One Horse Shay in its state of near
collapse. Comments were passed among the group inside as to
the man's shabby appearance, his business and ultimate destination.
He was soon forgot in the midst of the ensuing conversation
between several young lawyers, one of whom remarked
that he had heard a sermon delivered which equalled the eloquence
and fluency usually reserved to lawyers pleading their
cases. This brought forth eventually a heated discussion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
merits of the Christian religion, argued pro and con by those
present lasting from six in the evening till eleven.</p>

<p>Finally one young fellow turned to the quiet old traveller.
The latter had sat with apparent interest and meekness throughout
the five-hour debate and had not joined in. The question
was asked, "Well, old gentleman, what's your opinion?"</p>

<p>The reply lasted almost an hour; he answered argument for
argument in the exact order in which each had occurred and with
the greatest simplicity and dignity. At the conclusion no one
spoke for some time. At last inquiry was ventured as to his
identity. He was Chief Justice John Marshall.</p>

<p>In his <i>Virginia: A History of the People</i> John Esten Cooke relates
this story. An Irish laborer and his wife came in 1767 to the
lower valley country and stopped at the home of a Mr. and Mrs.
Strode, German landowner. For several years they lived with
the German family and during the time a son was born. When
they decided to push on farther south the Strode children followed,
begging that they leave the little boy behind with them.
They had become very much attached to the baby and were
reluctant to see him go away. The parents naturally refused the
request. While stopping for a short rest they placed the baby on
the ground and the children would have run off with him if
they could.</p>

<p>The family kept its southward course and at last reached the
Waxhaws in North Carolina. Here the boy grew up and later
his name was familiar to every one&mdash;Andrew Jackson, seventh
President of the United States.</p>

<p>The legend may or may not be true, according to Mr. Cooke.
But at least there was a clear, cool spring on the Strode farm
called "Jackson's Spring."</p>

<p>A pamphlet compiled at Winchester on "What To See and
How To See It" tells us that the town changed hands seventy-six
times during the War Between the States. Other sources give a
fraction of a smaller figure. The exact number of times the town
was under first Federal then Confederate forces does not matter,
but it is well to know that so much of the fighting took place
around the neighborhood. More will be said about the Valley
warfare later on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Beginning in November 1861 and continuing until March of
the following year General Jackson had his headquarters in Winchester.
After finding suitable quarters he sent for his wife who
had remained at their home in Lexington, Virginia. Colonel
Henderson in his well-known book, <i>Stonewall Jackson,</i> quotes
Mrs. Jackson as saying of her stay that Winter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Winchester ladies were amongst the most famous of Virginia
housekeepers, and lived in a good deal of old-fashioned elegance and
profusion. The old border town had not then changed hands with the
conflicting armies, as it was destined to do so many times during the
war. Under the rose-colored light in which I viewed everything that
winter, it seemed to me that no people could have been more cultivated,
attractive, and noble-hearted. Winchester was rich in happy
homes and pleasant people; and the extreme kindness and appreciation
shown General Jackson by all bound us to them so closely and warmly
that ever after that winter he called the place our 'war home'."</p></div>

<p>Winchester rightly claims that it is in the "heart of the apple
industry," for thousands of acres are devoted to the growing of
fine apples. Over a million barrels are harvested annually and at
Winchester, we believe, is the largest cold storage apple plant
in the world.</p>

<p>Celebrating its crop each year, the city stages an apple blossom
festival during the latter part of April or the first of May when
the orchards for miles around are filled with the delicately tinted
pink blooms. This is a lavish sort of entertainment. A queen is
selected to reign over the festivities, her maids are invited from
surrounding sections of the country to participate in the parades
and balls which are given during the days' programs. If you
haven't been already, plan to attend an Apple Blossom Festival
and see Virginia in one of her prettiest moods&mdash;with gay young
ladies and bloom-filled orchards.</p>

<p>You know of the "Tom, Dick and Harry" trio of Winchester
and its neighborhood, don't you? They are the world famous
Byrd brothers, descendants of the founder of Richmond, Colonel
William Byrd of Westover on the James. Tom Byrd is a successful
planter and orchardist. Richard Byrd is noted for his
polar expeditions; now he is devoting all his energies towards
the perpetuation of peace for our country. Harry Byrd was at
one time a progressive young Governor of the State and now
serves as a Senator in the United States Congress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="The_Valley_Pike" id="The_Valley_Pike"></a>The Valley Pike</h2>


<p>"Route Eleven" as the road is called from Winchester to Bristol
is one of the most historic as well as the most beautiful in all
Virginia. It stretches, like a broad silver ribbon, for over three
hundred and fifty miles. It begins at the northern end of the
Valley, near the Potomac River, and leads one through the fertile
Valley, southward and winding ever westward through the Blue
Ridge and the <a name="corr_3"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: Alleghaney">Alleghany</ins> mountains.</p>

<p>Let us review this famous driveway. Long before the coming
of the white men, the Indians followed almost a natural trail, as
they journeyed back and forth into the richest hunting grounds
known anywhere in all their world. Along it they found the big
elk, bear, buffalo, wolves, foxes, wild turkeys and smaller game.</p>

<p>The first pioneers followed this Indian Trail, as they called it.
Then, as they developed the country more and more, they brought
in horses and oxen. This made a wider road and soon they were
rolling their hogsheads of tobacco and grain over it. They carried
their products to market in heavy wagons, swapping their wild
bees' honey, venison, grain, and hand-woven linen for the precious
salt, sugar, iron and lead. Over this road came an ever increasing
number of other pioneers to settle near those already living in
the rich Valley. They brought their furniture, guns, and families
and a most fervent respect for the priceless liberty to be found
there. Liberty where one could worship God as one pleased.
Liberty where one's children could share in the development and
in a new country, full of opportunities.</p>

<p>Historians claim that the young George Washington surveyed
this road through the Valley. Engineers today say that he did
a wonderful work and that they would make a few changes in it.
Let us look at some of the famous names of those who lived near
or travelled over it. Some of them lived within sight of the
beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains while others visited from one
end of it to the other. As one travels near Winchester, he reads
the names of John Marshall, George Washington, and General
Morgan. From Charlottesville one reads of Patrick Henry visiting
Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. There, too, were Lewis and
Clarke, men famous in the development of our West, the Mc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Cormicks,
the Houstons, the Austins and other noted Virginians
who went West and settled there.</p>

<p>By now the Road was being called by many names, such as
"The Old Indian Trail", "The Great Road", the "Settlers's
Road", while still others called it the "Wilderness Road".</p>

<p>Then came peace and prosperity after the French and Indian
War and that of the Revolution. Finer horses and carriages were
being brought into the Valley and so a better road had to be
built. Some thrifty soul suggested having a splendid road which
should be maintained by tollgates. And so was built the famous
"Valley Pike". This was the pride, not only of the Valley, but of
all Virginia and the South.</p>

<p>Interesting stories are told every day, as one travels over this
beautiful road, such as that of Charlotte Hillman who kept a tollgate
along the Pike. While Sheridan was making his famous raid
through the Valley (when he remarked that a crow travelling
through the countryside would have to carry a knapsack with
provisions for his flight), he came to the tollgate. Charlotte let
down the gate and demanded toll from the army before allowing
it to pass. The General and his staff paid the toll but he
refused to pay for the entire corps. She lifted the gate but cut a
notch on a tree for every ten soldiers who passed. At the close
of the War she presented the United States Government with a
bill&mdash;which is said to have been paid in full.</p>

<p>Today Route Eleven is known as the Lee-Jackson Highway, so
called in honor of Generals Robert Edward Lee and "Stonewall"
Jackson. As you travel through the Great Valley of Virginia may
you know more intimately the great men and women who have
built not only the Great Valley of Virginia, but who have helped
in the making of America. We hope this little book may make
you know them and love Virginia more ... and we hope you will
come again and again to enjoy the Great Valley of Virginia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Berryville</p>


<p>Long before the County of Clarke was ordered to be carved
from Frederick, a town was established called Battletown. This
was so called, says tradition, because of the rough and-tumble
fights of the gang who met there to drink their ale.</p>

<p>Daniel Morgan, a picturesque character of the Valley, thought
he had the right to stop such fights and so he frequently got into
the fray. Old records show that Morgan sometimes had to pay
a fine "for misbehavior." But no doubt it was here that he won
his strength and learned to out-match the toughs of the neighborhood.
Certainly he won a reputation for his prowess, and as a
general he won distinction.</p>

<p>The town changed its name in 1798 when it was granted a
charter and became Berryville. It was named for its founder
Benjamin Berry, who donated the land and when Clark County
was formed in 1836, Berryville was chosen as the county seat.</p>

<p>Tradition tells us that George Washington boarded with Captain
Charles Smith when he was in the Valley surveying for
Lord Fairfax. This home was about a half mile from the present
Berryville. His office while in the Valley was a small log building
which was used as a spring house for "Soldier's Rest." A cold
spring of water flows under the floor of the first room, which is
about twelve feet square. George used the room upstairs for his
sleeping quarters. It was there he kept his instruments and
carefully recorded in his diary his experiences. It was there he
made out his reports for Lord Fairfax. Howe, an early historian,
tells us about that youth of sixteen. Quoting Bancroft, he writes:
"The woods of Virginia sheltered the youthful George Washington,
the son of a widow. Born by the side of the Potomac,
beneath the roof of a Westmoreland farmer, almost from infancy
his lot had been the lot of an orphan. No academy had welcomed
him to its shade, no college crowned him with its honors, to read,
to write, to cipher&mdash;these had been his degrees of knowledge.
And now at sixteen years, in quest of an honest maintainance,
encountering intolerable toil, cheered onward by being able to
write to a boyhood friend, 'Dear Richard, a doubloon is my
constant gain every day, and sometimes six pistoles.' He was his
own cook, having no spit but a forked stick, no plate but a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
chip; roaming over the spurs of the Alleghanies and along the
banks of the Shenandoah, alive to nature, among skin-clad savages,
with their scalps and rattles, or uncouth emigrants that would
never speak English, rarely sleeping in a bed, holding a bear skin
a splendid couch, glad of a resting place for a night upon a
little hay, straw or fodder ... this stripling surveyor in the
woods, with no companion but his unlettered associates, and no
implements of science but his compass and chain, contrasted
strangely with his fellows. And yet God had not selected a
Newcastle, nor a monarch of the Hapsburg, nor of Hanover, but
the Virginia Stripling to give to human affairs and as far as events
can depend upon individuals, had placed the rights and destinies
of countless millions in the keeping of the widow's son."</p>

<p>While in the Valley of Virginia the young George Washington
learned how to tell the age of various trees by the thickness of
their bark. The older a tree is, the thicker the bark and it is
much rougher and thicker on the north side of the tree. He
learned to know the course of the winds and to get to the
leeward of his game when out hunting for food or skins. This
was done by putting his finger in his mouth and holding it
there until it became warm, then holding it high above his head;
the side which became cold showed him which way the wind was
blowing. He learned that the deer always seeks the sheltered
places and the leeward side of the hills. In rainy weather, they
keep in the open woods and on the highest grounds. He found
that the fur or skins of animals are good in all those months in
which an "R" is found in the spelling.</p>

<p>He learned how to track animals, to know the various birds'
songs and cries. He watched the hunters build their camp fires
and learned how to cook his own game.</p>

<h2><a name="Front_Royal" id="Front_Royal"></a>Front Royal</h2>


<p>As most of us know, Charles II lived in such extravagant style
and had such a luxurious court he had difficulty in keeping his
bills paid. He was accustomed to resorting to one scheme after
another in order to raise revenue. At one time he dreamt of
great wealth from the Virginia colony through its tobacco crop&mdash;and
it did supply him generously with taxes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Realizing a lucrative business might be established by trading
in furs with the Indians, Charles ordered Governor Berkeley to
send explorers beyond the mountains. The governor chose a man
of whom history records very little. John Lederer was at one
time a Franciscan monk. He obviously had leanings towards an
adventuresome life. In 1761 he set out for the West, under the
compulsion of Governor Berkeley. The party was composed of
five Indian guides and a Colonel Catlett. They went through
Manassas Gap in the neighborhood of Front Royal.</p>

<p>The expedition proved a failure because of the unfriendly
attitude of the Indians and the roughness of the country. Charles
was destined for another disappointment.</p>

<p>White settlers came to Front Royal as early as 1734 and built
their little houses in sheltered coves near the Shenandoah. Soon,
news of the desirable home sites in the Valley attracted other
settlers. Lehewtown was the early name given the settlement.</p>

<p>Rough characters began to find their way here and shootings,
brawls and hard drinking were the order of the day&mdash;so much so
that the place later became known as "Helltown." However, it
acquired more dignity and order with the years and about 1788
it was incorporated under the name of Front Royal. And why
did the town get its double name? There are several existing
legends as to the derivation of the town's present name.</p>

<p>The trails from Page and Shenandoah valleys crossed at this
point. One account states that the settlers going from one place
to another met at a tavern at the crossroads where the Royalist
troops were stationed. Hence ground around the town was a
military post. When the sentry on guard called out "Front" and
the settlers were not able to give the password "Royal." The
name Camp Front Royal was given the post and later it was
known by the last two words.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A particularly tragic battle occurred at Front Royal in May,
1862, when the First Maryland Regiment of the Union forces met
the First Maryland Regiment of the Confederate Army. It happened
when Stonewall Jackson came out suddenly from the Page
valley and attacked General Banks' left wing stationed at this
town. The Federals were defeated and were driven on through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Rivertown where they tried hard to burn the bridges and cut off
the Confederate advance. The cavalry of the latter under Ewell
saved the bridges which spanned the two branches of the Shenandoah
River. About two weeks later the Confederates themselves
burned the bridges, but this was after Jackson had flanked Banks
away from the position at Strasburg, followed him to Winchester
and won a victory there.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Flint_Hill" id="Flint_Hill"></a>Flint Hill</h2>


<p>In 1861 young Albert Willis was a theological student. Like
many others, he left his studies to enter the services of the
Confederate Army. While he was not a chaplain in Mosby's
Rangers in which he had enlisted, he did carry on his pastoral
work with the men by giving them Bibles, holding some services,
and writing home for those who could not write; no day passed
during which he did not find an opportunity to be of service to
the men.</p>

<p>One day in October, 1864 he was granted a furlough and was
riding southward to Culpeper, hoping to reach his home in that
county. Not far away from Flint Hill his horse lost a shoe, so he
stopped at Gaines Mill. There was a rickety old blacksmith shop
at the crossroads. It had been raining and he was very wet.
While the horse was being shod, he stood near the fire to dry
his boots. The beat of the hammer on the iron drowned out
the sounds of approaching horses on which rode Federal soldiers.</p>

<p>Willis was taken captive and joined another prisoner outside.
The two Confederates were told that one of them must die in
reprisal for the death of a Federal soldier who had been killed
the day before.</p>

<p>The prisoners were carried before General William H. Powell,
Union Cavalry leader. Someone told General Powell that Mr.
Willis was a chaplain.</p>

<p>"If you are a chaplain," General Powell told him, "your life
will be spared."</p>

<p>"I am not a chaplain," the young Confederate replied, "I am a
soldier, fighting in the ranks."</p>

<p>General Powell then told the Confederates that one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
would be hanged within an hour. They would be given straws to
draw lots. In this way would one be spared.</p>

<p>Willis replied that he was a Christian and was not afraid to
die. He insisted that the other Confederate who was a married
man, be set free. The doomed man was led out to a spot on the
road near Flint Hill. A rope was placed around his neck while
the other end was tied to a young sapling which had been bent
down by the weight of several Federal soldiers.</p>

<p>While the preparations were being made, young Willis knelt
down and prayed. A witness said he never heard such a beautiful
prayer, lacking all bitterness. When he was through, the men
released the tree and it sprang into its natural position, swinging
Willis high into the air, where the body was left.</p>

<p>When the Federals had gone, Mr. John Ricketts came by with
a companion and they cut down the rope, took the body of the
brave Confederate and buried it in the cemetery at Flint Hill.
Today there is a stone which marks his resting place and every
Spring women go and place flowers on his grave. Nearby is a
small chapel named in honor of him&mdash;"Willis Chapel."</p>

<p>General Powell knew that young Willis was not accused as a
spy, but he was carrying out an order, issued in August 1864 by
General U. S. Grant, which read: "When any of Mosby's men are
caught hang them without trial."</p>

<h2><a name="The_Skyline_Drive" id="The_Skyline_Drive"></a>The Skyline Drive</h2>


<p>This world famous drive is not very old in point of years, but
its lure has and is attracting thousands of visitors every week to
see the beauties along its borders. Beginning at the northern
entrance at Front Royal, one winds around curving grades of
finely built roads which pass through great forests of oak, walnut,
maple and wonderful specimens of evergreens.</p>

<p>West of the Drive one sees the eastern section of the Shenandoah
Valley and Massanutten Mountain which divides the Shenandoah
River into two forks for fifty miles or more. The river winds
in and out and at one place the guide will point out eleven bits of
blue river spots as it makes as many turns through the Valley.
One thinks of old patchwork quilts as he looks into the Valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
below, for there are patches of green fields, oblong bits of blue
water, red roofs of barns and homes, besides the various shades of
greenwood lots.</p>

<p class="caption">View Along the Skyline Drive in the
Shenandoah National Park</p></div>

<p>And no matter when or how often one goes, the views are
never the same. Sometimes the blue haze from the Blue Ridge
Mountains makes the sunlight turn to a golden mist. Clouds
often cast huge moving shadows over the fields and forests below&mdash;and
sometimes they shut out the patchwork entirely, leaving
the visitor in a gray world, with only himself and the clouds
below and above. But this is unusual.</p>

<p>Tall stark gray chestnut trees make a striking contrast against
the greens and flowers, especially in the Fall when the leaves are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
so brilliantly colored. These once-producing nut trees were killed
by blight years ago.</p>

<p>Occasionally one's attention is caught by a moving object high
above on some peak. This will prove, upon investigation, to be
a hiker, or maybe two or more. Every year more and more of
these nature lovers are using the Appalachian Trail, which, as you
know, is the foot-trail from Maine to Georgia. It was through
the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club that this link in the trail
was included in the Skyline Drive and they maintain locked
shelters for hikers along the way within the park.</p>

<p>Other trails invite one to lofty peaks through wild canyons and
into groves of giant hemlocks. Another takes one through White
Oak Canyon where a stream of pure water tumbles over huge
rocks and makes a snow-white misty spray. Here one sees rare
wild flowers, ferns, moss and herbs. There are trout lilies,
Solomon's-seal, Hepaticæ and many other varieties of flowers.</p>

<p>There is a trail to Big and Little Devil's Staircases where two
hundred foot cliffs protect narrow canyons filled with maidenhair
fern, spleenwort, cinnamon, wild parsley, ginseng and ginger.
Tall maple and tulip trees are lovingly intertwined by such clinging
vines as trumpet vines and honeysuckle while at their feet
grow rare ferns and carpets of moss. One hears the songs of the
birds and sees the flashing of their brilliant colored wings.</p>

<p>Not far from Mary's Rock is Skyland. Here the tourist finds
accommodations for overnight or longer. Big roaring fires at
evening make visitors linger to listen to the stories of the Valley.</p>

<p>Horseback riding is great sport for the Skyline guests who
explore the various trails nearby.</p>

<p>The visitor may leave the drive at Panorama and go west down
the mountain to Luray. Or he may go east from Panorama down
a lovely road to Sperryville. Then on Route 211 he may motor
north to Washington or, if he would like to go by way of Culpeper,
Madison, Orange and Fredericksburg, he would find a
rolling country and inviting roads to the west, south and east.</p>

<p>If the visitor would continue the drive to Swift Run Gap, he
could go over the Spotswood Trail to Elkton and to the Valley
beyond. If he would go east, he would also use the Spotswood
Trail to Stanardsville and Gordonsville, then to Orange or to
Charlottesville.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Who dreamed the dream or had the first vision of the Skyline
Drive? What farsighted men started the movement which resulted
in our national government's making a great scenic park
in Virginia?</p>

<p>A bulletin from the <i>Commonwealth</i> gives the following
summary:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The movement which has made this area a national park was
begun in 1924 when the director of the National Park Service and the
Secretary of the Interior conferred on the establishment of a park in
the southern Appalachian Mountains. The Secretary appointed a committee
to choose the most attractive and suitable area; in December,
1924, his committee voted unanimously for the area of the Blue Ridge
mountains between Front Royal and Waynesboro to be the first large
national park in the East....</p>

<p>"Acquisition of the area was a very difficult task. In 1926 the
newly created Virginia State Commission on Conservation and Development
started field work, and the Shenandoah National Park
Association began a campaign to raise funds for the purchase of the
land. The required area was made up of 3,870 separate tracts. Most
of the owners did not wish to sell; land titles were not clear nor
boundaries well defined; sufficient money to make the purchase was not
available. Congress reduced the minimum area required for administration,
protection, and development of the park by the National Park
Service. Certain individuals made large donations. The Virginia legislature
appropriated $1,000,000 for acquisition and passed a special
law providing for wholesale condemnation of the land. Finally, in
1935, at a total cost of approximately $2,000,000, 275 square miles
were acquired, and the deed to the park area was presented to the
United States government by the State of Virginia.</p>

<p>"The completion of this tremendous task of acquiring and establishing
the Shenandoah National Park has made available to the people
of the United States, for recreational and educational purposes, an
unusually attractive region of mountains, hollows, dashing streams,
forests and flowers.</p>

<p>"The mountains rise to a maximum height of slightly more than
4,000 feet above sea level, or approximately 3,200 feet above the
surrounding country."</p></div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Strasburg" id="Strasburg"></a>Strasburg</h2>


<p>We can hardly mention a Valley town which has retained its
original name throughout the years. What is now known as
Strasburg was in the beginning called Staufferstadt, which indi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>cates
its German background. Peter Stover was the founder from
whom the settlement took its name but when he had the town
incorporated in 1761 he changed it to Strasburg in honor of his
home city in Germany.</p>

<p>There are evidences of the pioneer life of the Valley to be
seen near here. A house built about 1755 and occupied by the
Hupps was so constructed as to serve efficiently as a fort during
the Indian raids; this may still be seen. The home of George
Bowman, a son-in-law of Joist Hite, is also close by Strasburg.</p>

<p>Joist Hite had four famous grandsons born at this Bowman
home. John was a governor of Kentucky. Abraham was a
Colonel in the Revolutionary War and Isaac also served in that
war. Joseph served under General George Rogers Clark in the
expedition to the Northwest Territory.</p>

<p>The story is told that a party of eight Indians with a white
man named Abraham Mitchell killed George Miller and his wife
and two children just two miles from Strasburg. They also killed
John Dellinger and took his wife and baby prisoners.</p>

<p>A group of white men set out to find them and overtook the
Indians in the South Branch Mountains. They fired upon the
Indians and killed one of them, allowing the others to make their
escape. Mrs. Dellinger was forgotten in their flight so she came
home with her neighbors. She told them the Indians had killed
her baby by dashing out its brains on a tree&mdash;a favorite means
of execution with them.</p>

<p>Samuel Kercheval, who so frequently is quoted by us and of
whom we have written elsewhere is buried near Strasburg at
"Harmony Hall."</p>

<p>The town saw Union and Confederate troops march by during
the length of the war and several battles took place not far
distant. A few trench lines may still be seen around the countryside.
"Banks' Folly" was erected by General Banks when he
expected Jackson to invade the territory from the south and later
found to his dismay that the Confederates had entered the Valley
from the opposite direction. Signal Knob on top of Massanutten
Mountain was used by the latter general as a means of communication
with the main division of the army on the Rappahannock
River.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Orkney_Springs" id="Orkney_Springs"></a>Orkney Springs</h2>


<p>Orkney Springs, earlier known as the Yellow Springs, was
named for the Earl of Orkney and was surveyed by George
Washington, according to some accounts. The Springs may be
reached by travelling west of Mount Jackson.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Orkney Springs are composed of several lively springs and
are strongly chalybeate. Everything the water touches or passes
through, or over, is beautifully lined with a bright yellow fringe or
moss. The use of this water is found beneficial for the cure of several
complaints. A free use of this water acts as a most powerful cathartic,
as does also a small quantity of the fringe or moss, mixed with
common water."</p></div>

<p>So stated the historian Howe concerning the Springs. Around
the waters there grew up a tiny village which accommodates the
visitors to the section. An excellent hotel caters to the guests
who seek either quiet and rest or zestful games.</p>

<p>Near Orkney Springs there is a beautiful outdoor shrine where
the Episcopal Church holds regular and impressive services during
the Summer months&mdash;Shrinemont.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Stephens_City" id="Stephens_City"></a>Stephens City</h2>


<p>An act of the General Assembly in 1758 made Stephens City,
or Stephensburg as it was then known, the second town in the
Valley. The first was Winchester. Lewis Stephens the founder
of this town came to Virginia with Joist Hite in 1732.</p>

<p>Later on this was a thriving town manufacturing the Newtown-Stephensburg
wagon that was the pride of teamsters who travelled
all roads leading south and west. They took merchandise into
the wilderness and returned with furs, skins and other products
sent back by those settlers who had pushed on farther into the
wilds of Virginia. Many a covered wagon which saw the plains
of the Middle West had its birth in Stephensburg.</p>

<p>When the Forty-Niners created companies which sent supplies
to the gold fields of California they found that few wagons
lasted more than six months. At last they began to order those
being made in Stephensburg. These were found to be sturdier in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
build and could stand the strain of the rough roads and paths
longer than other wagons on the market.</p>

<p>The stores in the town were good ones, and often covered
wagons came in drawn by splendid horses. The drivers of these
teams put up overnight at the old taverns and many of the
citizens gathered after supper to hear the news of what was
going on in Alexandria or in Tennessee. The drivers would be
called personal shoppers today, for they brought lists of articles
to be carried back into the far-off country for the convenience of
the homesteaders there. The lists probably included sugar, tea
and coffee, cloth by the bolt and household articles. You can
imagine the joy with which the covered wagons would be sighted
days later!</p>

<p>During Jackson's Valley Campaign the village was known as
Newtown and mention is made in this book of fighting in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Today the main industry centers around lime which is found

<h2><a name="Middletown" id="Middletown"></a>Middletown</h2>


<p>As an early village this was known as Senseny Town, in honor
of the doctor by that name who owned the land. In 1795 it was
called Middletown. Long ago it was a manufacturing town and
was noted for the fine clocks and watches which were splendid
time-keepers for the punctual and thrifty Valley folk. In fact, the
demands for them came from far and near. The old wooden
wheels were first used, then brass was introduced and the watch-makers
learned to make the eight-day clocks&mdash;the last word in
time-keepers until the advent of the modern electric clocks. The
manufacturers of the watches and clocks soon made instruments
for surveyors as well as the much needed compasses.</p>

<p>The first successful effort to produce a machine to take the
place of the flail and threshing floor for threshing wheat from
the straw had its start in this same town. The machines were a
marvel in their day and the villagers talked for months at the
time when the machine beat out one hundred bushels of grain in
one day!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h3>PIONEER LIFE</h3>


<p>Samuel Kercheval as a boy saw many of the pioneer men and
women who had cut their homes out of the wilderness. He never
tired hearing of how they had left Germany, and later had come
down from Pennsylvania into the Valley. He himself could
remember many of the "Newcomers" who were themselves
pioneers. He loved the stories of the forts, the Indian raids and
the customs of the Germans and Scotch-Irish. He later began
to write down many of these stories and after he was older he
rode up and down the Valley gathering more and more stories
and reading wills and old records. Nothing was of too little value
for him to record, even accounts of the freaks of nature, like a
six-legged calf, snakes and other animals.</p>

<p>When Kercheval's friends insisted that he write a book about
the Valley, he objected until they told him how much the children
of the country would enjoy stories of their grandparents. His
own children (there had been fourteen of them in all), like all
children, loved stories. Now he began to get his notes in shape
and about one hundred years after the first settlers came into the
Valley, Samuel Kercheval's <i>History of the Valley of Virginia</i> was
ready for the publishers.</p>

<p>This was so popular that all the first edition was soon exhausted.
How pleased he was with the demands for more of
them! However, he died before the second edition came out.
He lived at the time of his death in 1845 at "Harmony Hall" near
Strasburg. This had at one time been a fort. During an Indian
raid, we are told, sixteen families sought shelter within its old
stone walls. They lived together so peaceably that they gave it
the name of "Harmony Hall."</p>

<p>It is from Kercheval that we get the first pictures of the
Valley. He writes that it was long beautiful prairie, with tall
rich grasses, five and six feet tall, with fringes of sturdy timbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
following its swiftly running streams. He describes the kinds
of soils and tells which is rich and which is poor. For instance
he says where one finds slate he may rest assured the soil will
not produce very good crops. On the other hand, where one finds
limestone the soil will produce fine products, grains and fruits.</p>

<p>Metal was found in some of the hillsides and mountains.
An Englishman named Powell found silver ore on the mountain
which bears his name. He smeltered the silver and from it made
coins. This was breaking the laws, of course, and soon officers
were attempting to arrest him. Powell fled to his mountain
where he had a small fort hidden, and for years eluded them.
After many years men found his little shop where he smeltered
the ore and Kercheval himself saw the crude crucible in which
the ore was refined and the iron utensils also.</p>

<p>Kercheval tells that many of the farmers found it difficult to
plough their lands and to make crops because of the innumerable
small and large stones which they found everywhere. At last
they decided to get rid of them and built many of the stone
walls which one sees up and down the mountain sides, along
winding roads and enclosing picturesque homes. He says the soil
is so rich that seeds do not need to be planted very deep, as they
will germinate if there is only enough soil to cover them.</p>

<p>There were great sugar-maple trees too and he tells of those
"sugar hills" in which there are four or five hundred acres of
trees. They even look like sugar loaves from a distance and
today on Paddy's Mountain you may still see some of them. You
may already have guessed that the name Paddy was in honor of
the owner Patrick Blake, an Irishman who built in the gap which
is named for him.</p>

<p>Kercheval lists carefully all the various healing springs and
gives the properties of each. He even gives the names of many
persons who were benefitted by drinking from or bathing in them.</p>

<p>Let us pause here and read about these pioneers, how they
built their houses, how they dressed, and something of their superstitions,
manners and customs.</p>

<p>The first settlers built plain sturdy houses made mostly from
rough hewn logs. Some of these were covered with split clap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>boards,
having weight poles to keep them in place. Many of them
had no floors except the earth itself. If made of wood, they
used rough logs, split in two and roughly smoothed with a broad
ax. However, as they improved the lands and their families grew,
some larger houses were built of stone, which the men and boys
brought in from the fields.</p>

<p>The married men generally shaved their heads and they wore
wigs or linen caps. When the Revolutionary War broke out this
custom was stopped for they could no longer buy wigs from
Europe and none were made in this country. There was little
linen, so they could not get enough for other needs and they
could do without caps.</p>

<p>The men's coats were mostly made with broad backs and
straight short skirts. These had huge pockets with flaps. The
waistcoats had skirts nearly down to the knees and pockets also.
Their breeches were so short they hardly reached to their knees,
and they were fastened with a tight band. Their stockings were
drawn up under the knee-hand and tied with a red or blue garter
below the knee so it could be seen. Their shoes were made of
coarse leather, with straps and they were fastened with buckles of
brass for every day&mdash;maybe with silver for Sundays and holidays.
The men's hats were either of wool or fur with a round crown
three or four inches in height and with a very broad brim. The
shirt collar was only a narrow band and over it was worn a white
linen stock drawn together at the ends and fastened with a broad
metal buckle.</p>

<p>The women wore a short gown and petticoat of plain materials
and a calico cap. Their hair was combed back from the forehead
and made into a plain knot at the nape of the neck.</p>

<p>The women and girls worked in the fields and wore no shoes
except in the winter. They worked from dawn 'til dark, for they
milked, churned, made cheese, washed and ironed for the family,
cooked, spun and wove, knitted stockings and quilted in their
leisure moments. Kercheval tells us how they made apple butter
and sourkrout. Of the latter he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sourkrout is made of the best of cabbage. A box about three
feet in length and six or seven inches wide, with a sharp blade fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
across the bottom, something on the principle of the jack plane, is
used for cutting the cabbage. The head being separated from the
stalk and stripped of its outer leaves is placed in this box and run back
and forth. The cabbage thus cut up is placed in a barrel, a little salt is
sprinkled on from time to time, then pressed down very closely and
covered at the open head. In the course of three or four weeks it
acquires a sourish taste and to persons accustomed to the use of it is a
very agreeable food. It is said the use of it within the last few years
on boards of ship has proved it to be the best preventive known
for scurvy. The use of it is becoming pretty general among all classes
in the Valley."</p></div>

<p>Kercheval even tells us what the pioneers did for medicine.
When he was a boy he saw a man brought into the fort on horseback,
who had been bitten by a rattlesnake. One of the men
dragged the snake, fastened to a forked stick, behind the victim.
The body of the snake was cut into small pieces, split and laid
on the wounded flesh. This, they claimed, would draw out the
poison of the bite. When this was done, the snake was burned to
ashes. During this process, others gathered chestnut leaves and
boiled them in a pot. Wide pieces of chestnut bark were applied
to the man's wound and the chestnut-leaf mixture poured over
some of the boiled leaves which had been made into a <a name="corr_4"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: poultrice">poultice</ins>.
This was kept up during the first day and if not improved, the
treatment was continued the next.</p>

<p>Others suggested using boiled plantain, cooked in milk, which
was given to the patient. Walnut fern was another remedy for
snakebite. The braver patient submitted to cupping, sucking the
wound or having someone cut out the flesh around the bite.</p>

<p>Gunshot wounds were treated with slippery-elm bark, flax seed
poultices or by scraping the wound itself and cauterizing it.</p>

<p>The people suffering from rheumatism were rubbed with oil
made from rattlesnakes, bears, geese, wolves or any wild animal.
This was put on a flannel rag and bound to the parts affected.</p>

<p>There were all kinds of syrups made from herbs such as spike
nard and elecampane for coughs and tuberculosis. The Germans
used songs or incantations for the cure of burns, nose-bleed and
toothache. For one afflicted with erysipelas the blood of a black
cat was given. Hence there were few cats which had not lost
parts of their ears or tails.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>The sports of the boys in those early days were mostly those
which developed their physical bodies. The boys were given a
gun almost as soon as they were strong enough to carry one.
They learned to make their own bows and to sharpen their own
arrows and many of them could shoot as straight as the Indians
who still roamed the hills.</p>

<p>Throwing the tomahawk was another favorite sport. This axe-like
weapon with its handle will make so many turns in a given
distance. With a little practice a boy soon learned to throw his
tomahawk and strike a tree as he walked through the forest.</p>

<p>When a boy was twelve, he had his own small rifle and pouch
and was made a member of the fort. He was given a certain port
hole through which he took careful aim. He was often allowed
to go with older men on hunting trips if he had proved himself
worthy to be "among men."</p>

<p>Dancing as we know it was unknown, but few ever enjoyed
anything more than those boys and girls did dancing their jigs
and reels. Their music was simple and singing was something
both old and young enjoyed to the fullest. Story-telling was an
art then, and year by year, old, old tales grew longer and longer
and Jack the hero, always conquered all the giants.</p>

<p>There was witchcraft in the Valley too, and when a crow or
calf died or was sick, the owner often thought a witch had shot
it with a hair ball or with some kind of curse. When a man lost
his cunning in his once good aim, he was sure some one had put
a "spell" on him. Some actually believed men were changed into
horses and after being bridled, they were ridden all over the
countryside. Many men thought this was why their bones ached
and they felt too tired to work their farms.</p>

<p>The men who did strange things were spoken of as wizards.
Some called them witch-masters, and these claimed they could
stop the mischievous work of the witches and cure baffling
diseases.</p>

<p>When a child was born with a frail body, or developed rickets,
it was often thought to be caused by the spells of someone
unfriendly to the family.</p>

<p>If one would get rid of the witch in his neighborhood a picture
of the supposed witch was drawn on a board or on a stump and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
shot at with a bullet which contained a bit of silver. This bullet,
if it struck the picture, was thought to put a spell on the witch.</p>

<p>We may smile at the thought of those superstitions, but few of
us, if we are honest, will not admit that we have one pet superstition
just as foolish as those referred to above.</p>

<p>Kercheval tells us how difficult it often was for the farmer
to retain all of his crops. There were so many animals, like the
squirrels and raccoons, which liked their grains. Storms would
come and huge trees would fall on their fences, letting their
horses and cattle get into the fields.</p>

<p>He makes us realize how difficult it was to procure the necessities
of life. Where, for instance did they get the mills with
which to grind their grains, where the instruments with which
to make their farming implements and their household cooking
utensils? Who were their weavers, their shoemakers, tailors, tanners
and wagon makers? <a name="corr_5"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: Af">Of</ins> course there were none, for each
farmer and his family had to rely on what they could do with
their own hands or what they could trade to some neighbor in
return for something done for him.</p>

<p>The first mills or hominy blocks were made of wood. A block
of wood about three feet long was burned at one end, wide at
the mouth and narrow at the bottom, so that when the pestle hit
the corn it was thrown up and as it fell down to the bottom it was
mashed. Gradually, each grain of corn was ground to a like size.
When the corn was soft, as it was in the Fall, this grinding made
a fine meal for mush or "journey cake" as they called this form
of bread. However, this was slow work later on when corn
got hard.</p>

<p>The farmer also used a different kind of mill. He used a sweep
made of springy wood, thirty feet or more long. This pole
was supported by two forks, placed about a third of its length
from its butt end where it was securely fastened to some firm
object. To this was attached a large mortise, a piece of sapling
five or six inches in diameter and eight or more long. The lower
end was shaped like a pestle and a pin of wood was put through it
at a proper height so two people could work the sweep at once.</p>

<p>Kercheval says he remembers the one which he helped work
in his own home. It was made of a sugar-tree sapling and was
kept almost in constant use either by his own family or by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
neighbors who came to use it. He says these sweeps were used
to make gunpowder from the saltpetre caves which the settlers
soon found.</p>

<p>The women often used a grater for the corn when it was very
soft. This was made of a piece of tin, a few holes punched in
on one side and then nailed to a block of wood and the corn
scraped against it. This produced a form of corn-meal but was a
very tedious method. Another kind was a mill made of two
circular stones. The one on the bottom was called the bed stone
and the upper one the runner. These were placed in a hoop
with a spout for discharging the meal. A staff was let into the
hole in the upper surface of the runner near the outer edge and
its upper end through a hole in a board fastened to a joist above.
The grain was put into the runner by hand. This type of mill,
is one of the earliest ever known by man.</p>

<p>Then every man tanned his own leather. The tan-vat was a
huge tub which was sunk into the ground. A quantity of bark
was quickly gotten each spring when the farmer cleared his land.
This was first dried then brought in and on rainy days, the bark
was stripped, shaved and pounded on a block of wood with an
ax or mallet. Ashes were used in place of lime for taking off the
hair from the skins of animals. They did not have fish-oil, so
the settlers substituted bear's grease, or lard made from boiling the
fat of these animals. This oil was used to make the leather
soft and pliable. The leather was often very coarse, but it was
tough and wore well. They made their blacking or polish for
their shoes by mixing soot with lard. Not every man could make
shoes, but everyone could make shoepacks, an article similar to
the moccasin.</p>

<p>Kercheval's father was a master weaver as well as a fine shoe
maker. He made all the shoes worn by his family and would not
let anyone else make his thread, as he thought no woman could
spin it as well as he could. He made all the woodenware called
set work. He hand-carved some of them, making grooves in
which he fitted hoops to hold the staves in place. During the
days when every man had to serve in some military service, the
elder Kercheval was not strong enough to fight. The men brought
all their firearms to him and he repaired them. He could straighten
a crooked gun barrel with ease and file off any broken edges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Kercheval's father had been to school for only six weeks, yet
he read, worked hard problems in mathematics and wrote letters,
not only for himself, but for many of his friends. He drew up
bonds, deeds of conveyance and wrote other articles for them. He
taught his boy to use his hands, for Samuel tells that as a boy,
he wove garters, belts and shot pouches. He, too, could make
looms. He traded well, for he says he would swap a belt for a
man's labor for a day, or give one to a man for making a hundred
fence rails.</p>

<p>An amusing custom developed among the German settlers
regarding their weddings. Young men and women, termed
"waiters," were selected to help officiate at a wedding. The
groomsmen were proud to wear highly embroidered white aprons
on such an occasion, for it was symbolic of protection to the bride.
Each waiter tried to keep the bride from having her slippers stolen
from her feet during the festivities. If she did sustain the loss
the young man had to pay for it with a bottle of wine, since the
bride's dancing depended upon its recovery.</p>

<p>Characterized by their strong religious beliefs it was only
natural for the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians to build their churches
as they built their little homes. Opequon Church south of
Winchester is thought by many to be the oldest church in the
Valley. Not so with the Germans. They did not attempt to
build separate houses of worship for a generation or more after
coming to the new section but they did hold regular services in
the homes of the settlers and waited until a better time to erect
churches.</p>

<p>There was an interesting custom among the Scotch-Irish at
their weddings, too. It was called "running for the bottle."
Usually the bride and groom went to the parson's home for the
marriage ceremony, attended by their friends on horseback. At
the conclusion of the ritual the young men took to their horses
and dashed for the bride's father's house. The man on the fleetest
horse was given a bottle of wine from which the returning bride
and groom first drank and then it was passed on to others. In
most instances the mad rush to the home was made in spite of
numerous trees and small brush which were cut down to serve as
obstacles in their paths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>At Winchester these two distinct nationalities got along fairly
well together. An example of their friendly relations is to be seen
in their "War of the Guelphs and Ghibellines." The Dutch on
St. Patrick's Day would parade through the village streets with
effigies of St. Patrick wearing a necklace of Irish potatoes and
his wife carrying an apron full of them.</p>

<p>And then on the day of St. Michael, the patron of the Dutch,
the Irish retaliated by holding aloft an effigy of the saint decorated
with a necklace of sourkrout.</p>

<p>As was to be expected these frolics occasionally went to the
extreme and ended before the judge in the log cabin courthouse.</p>

<p>It was hard for those early settlers to get such articles as salt,
iron, steel and casting. There were no stores where they could
purchase sugar, tea and hundreds of other necessities of today.
Pelts, furs or skins were their only money before they had time to
raise horses and cattle. In the Fall of the year, after all crops were
harvested, every settler's family formed an association with some
of their neighbors for starting a caravan.</p>

<p>This consisted of two packhorses. A bell and collar was put on
each horse, as were a pair of hobbles made from hickory withes.
Bags were packed on the back of the saddles in which to bring
back two bushels of alum salt, each bushel weighing eighty-four
pounds. Each horse carried two bags on the return journey.
This was not such a heavy load for a horse but one must remember
the animal also had to carry its own food. Somewhere along
the narrow trail, some of this grain was hidden until the return
journey. Large pouches or bags were also carried in which were
loaves of home-baked bread or "Journey Cake," a mixture of
Indian meal and water baked on an iron skillet and boiled ham
and cheese.</p>

<p>The men traded first in Baltimore, Hagerstown and Cumberland.
They also took along a cow and a calf, which was what
they paid for one bushel of the much needed salt. While the salt
was being weighed, no one was allowed to walk on the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Woodstock" id="Woodstock"></a>Woodstock</h2>


<p>First called Muellerstadt after its founder Jacob Miller, Woodstock
was granted its charter in 1761 by the General Assembly of
Virginia. Miller was farsighted in his plans for the community
and provided adequate building sites for homes and businesses.</p>

<p>The historian Kercheval tells an interesting account of the
appearance of Indians around Woodstock:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In 1766, the Indians made a visit to the neighborhood of Woodstock.
Two men by the name of Sheetz and Taylor had taken their
wives and children into a wagon, and were on their way to the fort.
At the narrow passage, three miles south of Woodstock, five Indians
attacked them. The two men were killed at the first onset, and the
Indians rushed to seize the women and children. The women, instead
of swooning at the sight of their bleeding, expiring husbands, seized
their axes, and with Amazonian firmness, and strength almost superhuman,
defended themselves and children. One of the Indians had
succeeded in getting hold of one of Mrs. Sheetz's children, and
attempting to drag it out of the wagon; but with the quickness of
lightning she caught her child in one hand, and with the other made a
blow at the head of the fellow which caused him to quit his hold to
save his life. Several of the Indians received pretty sore wounds in
this desperate conflict, and all at last ran off, leaving the two women
with their children to pursue their way to the fort."</p></div>

<p>When Lord Dunmore came to govern the colony of Virginia in
1772 the citizens passed a resolution endorsing his administration.
They requested that a new county be formed from Frederick
which would be called Dunmore County. Five years later, when
he began to have trouble with the colonists the people of Woodstock
instructed their burgess to get the name of their county
changed to Shenandoah. This name is retained to the present
time.</p>

<p>About six miles from Woodstock a Mr. Wolfe erected a fort on
Stony Creek years and years ago. He had a fine hunting dog and
at the time of our story Indians were lurking in the neighborhood.
This was during the period when the savages were endeavoring to
rid the Valley of the white men.</p>

<p>Mr. Wolfe went out hunting one morning and had not gone
far before his dog began to run around and around him, blocking
his path. Then he jumped up in front of his master, put his feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
on his shoulders and seemed to try to stop Wolfe's progress.
When the dog found he could not stop his master he ran back
towards the fort, then back to his master, all the time whining
a warning.</p>

<p>The hunter suspected some danger, so he kept his hand on his
gun and watched out for Indians. He soon saw two of them
behind a tree. Evidently they were waiting for their man to
come close enough for them to get a good shot at him. Mr.
Wolfe began to walk backward, making a rapid retreat to the fort.
Long afterwards someone asked Mr. Wolfe why he did not kill
the old dog since his years of usefulness were over and he was
apparently uncomfortable. He told the inquirer the story of how
the animal had saved his life and added, "I would sooner be
killed myself than suffer that dog to be killed."</p>

<p>"There is a time to every purpose under the heaven&mdash;a time of
war and a time of peace." So spoke one of Woodstock's most
famous sons, the Reverend John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, in
the Lutheran Church one Sunday morning after the Declaration
of Independence had been issued. After delivering an inspired
sermon taken from this text in which he reviewed his stand on
liberty, he dramatically cast off his black pulpit robes and revealed
to his astonished congregation his colonel's uniform of
the Revolutionary army. He was about thirty years old then and
had served the Woodstock flock for four years.</p>

<p>Dr. Wayland in his book <i>The German Element in the Shenandoah
Valley of Virginia</i>, suggests that the Rev. Mr. Muhlenberg
was associated with the Episcopal as well as the Lutheran church
and that "he seems beyond question to have received Episcopal
ordination.... His connection with the Church of England was
probably sought in order that his work as a clergyman might
receive the readier and fuller sanction."</p>

<p>Almost immediately after preaching his patriotic sermon he
raised a regiment among the Valley folk. Known as the Eighth
Virginia, or German Regiment, they saw hard service at Germantown,
Brandywine and Monmouth as well as in some of the
southern battlefields.</p>

<p>Before the close of the war Muhlenberg was made a brigadier-general
and after his retirement he lived in Pennsylvania, his
original home before coming to the Valley of Virginia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>A movement is under way at the present time to restore the
little church of the Lutheran faith where the colonel made his
firey sermon. Let us hope this may be accomplished so that we
may catch the inspiration of his remarks.</p>

<p>Woodstock saw the march of many feet during the War
Between the States; almost constantly were the troops passing
by, causing fields to be laid waste, crops to be confiscated and
stock to be carried off. But the little town conceals her war scars
well and today is a progressive community.</p>

<p>Massanutten Academy is located here and draws boys from all
over Virginia and a number of other States.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Lincoln Family</span></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, President Lincoln's forebears were
not poor and shiftless, but were influential and prosperous Virginians
who lived in the handsome old brick Colonial home
which, in a fine state of preservation, is still standing, with the
Lincoln family cemetery and slave burying-ground nearby.</p>

<p>The Lincoln homestead is near the little village of Edom, not
far from the Caverns of Melrose, and can be reached by turning
west from U. S. Highway 11 at these caverns, six miles north of
Harrisonburg. Visitors are welcome at this homestead. Exact
directions as to how to reach it can be obtained in the Melrose
Cavern's Lodge.</p>

<p>Thomas Lincoln, father of President Lincoln, was born in this
house. John Lincoln, great-grandfather of the President, moved
with his family into Virginia in 1768 where, as an influential
pioneer, he built the first brick unit of the beautiful Colonial
home.</p>

<p>John Lincoln was known as "Virginia John." Abraham Lincoln,
his eldest son and grandfather of the President, lived in
this homestead and was captain of a Virginia company during
the Revolution.</p>

<p>Captain Abraham Lincoln, with his son Thomas (father of the
President) moved to Kentucky in 1782, leaving Jacob Lincoln, a
brother of Captain Lincoln, in the Virginia homestead. Many
Lincolns, descendants of Jacob and other sons and daughters of
"Virginia John," now live near Melrose Caverns, in Harrisonburg
and elsewhere in Rockingham county.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>On February 24th, 1829, when Melrose Caverns were known as
"Harrison's Cave," Franklin Lincoln, grandson of Jacob and a
cousin of President Lincoln, entered the caverns and, by the light
of torches or candles, carved his name and the date. He later
fought in the Civil War as a Confederate soldier.</p>

<p>Also in these caverns is carved the name of John Lincoln,
possibly John Lincoln, Jr., who was one of Jacob's four brothers,
or perhaps "Virginia John" the pioneer, great-grandfather of the
President. There is no date carved by the name of John Lincoln.</p>

<p>In April, 1862, during the Civil War, a Federal soldier drew a
rough portrait of President Lincoln with charcoal upon a wall
farther back in the caverns. These Lincoln signatures and this
crude portrait can be distinctly seen in Melrose Caverns by
visitors today.</p>

<h2><a name="New_Market" id="New_Market"></a>New Market</h2>


<p>A little later in becoming settled than other Valley towns was
New Market, the progressive little place situated at the intersection
of the Valley Pike and Route 211 to Luray. Its charter
was granted in 1785 as the result of efforts made by Peter Palsel,
an early settler.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson's father, Peter Jefferson, was among the party
of surveyors who ran the land grant boundary for the Proprietor
of the Northern Neck, Lord Fairfax. This was done in 1746.
The old line is a short distance south of New Market.</p>

<p>The town was the scene in 1864 of the battle in which the
young and inexperienced but dauntless cadets from the Virginia
Military Institute at Lexington took such prominent part. The
wounded from their ranks were cared for by devoted women in
nearby houses. And what a percentage there was either wounded
or killed! Forty-six of the former and eight of the latter out of a
corps of only two hundred and twenty-one!</p>

<p>New Market is the center today of the caverns in the Valley,
for Shenandoah Caverns are to the north and Endless to the
south, while within a short drive you may reach Luray, Massanutten,
Melrose and Grand Caverns. Accommodations for the
tourists are numerous and fair throughout the vicinity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Several years ago a re-enactment of the Battle of New Market
occurred in which the corps from the Virginia Military Institute
pitted their strength against the United States Marines. Among
the spectators to this stirring War Between the States encounter
was the Secretary of the Navy.</p>

<p>He was impressed with the majesty of the Shenandoah Valley
and the legend of the name. Later he determined to name the
new navy dirigible Shenandoah&mdash;"The Daughter of the Stars."
For her christening a bottle of water from the meandering Shenandoah
River was used. And on her maiden flight from her berth
at Lakehurst the graceful ship flew over the lovely, peaceful
Valley from whence came her name.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Endless Caverns</span></h3>

<p>On the first of October, 1879 two boys went hunting. Their
dog chased a rabbit up the long slope of Mr. Reuben Zirkle's
pasture. The rabbit ran for his life and disappeared over a huge
rock.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">&quot;The Cypress Gardens&quot;, a Scene in Endless Caverns</p>
</div>
<p>The boys gave chase and boy-like, when they reached the rock
and found no rabbit, they pushed aside the heavy stone. Imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
how their eyes bulged when they looked down into a great hole
in the hill. Here was a find! Here was adventure, for who can
resist exploring a cave? The boys thought no longer of the rabbit.
They went in search of candles and a rope. Soon they were seeing
for the first time the lovely and strange kingdom underground.</p>

<p>The boys, no doubt like visitors, wondered how Nature had
carved these miracles. Today science has answered the question
for us and for the sake of those inquiring minds we will give in
part the story of how Mother Nature builds her caves.</p>

<p>"Thousands and thousands of years of surface waters, seeping
down through the earth, have dissolved and carried away the
limestone rock through various tiny cracks and crevices. As each
drop worked its way downward it carried coloring matter&mdash;iron,
maybe copper, which tints the beautiful columns. Tiny bits of
limestone formed and gradually built them up from the bottom;
these are called stalagmites. Others slowly forming from the tops
of the cave hung there and are termed stalactites. Then through
the years these grew until they met and formed the arches and
columns."</p>

<p>Though explorations were carried on for several years no end to
the rooms was seen. One channel after another was found, and
one room after another came into view, hence the name Endless
Caverns.</p>

<p>People from far and near came to see the wonders, and dances
were held in Alexander's Ballroom. The musicians had a high
rock on which they played their fiddles. Huge iron circles were
fastened to the ceiling and candles placed in them for lights.
One night one of the bold boys took a candle and pushed farther
into the cave. By the weird light he saw a glistening lake,
sparkling like diamonds. Upon investigation it turned out to be
a pool of clearest water and it reflected the white glittering crystal
roof which sheltered it. The name "Diamond Lake" was given it
and it has been admired by thousands of visitors.</p>

<p>Then for thirty years the beautiful caverns were closed to the
public. A party of visitors came to the Valley. Colonel Edward
Brown who stopped in New Market was fascinated with the
stories of the old caverns. He bought the property and the next
year the caverns were opened&mdash;in 1920. Today his son, Major
E. M. Brown, is the progressive owner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"The old entrance house has been replaced by a unique cave
house built of limestone boulders from the mountain side. Great
gates of hand-wrought iron bar the head of the stone steps which
lead downward. A lone lantern hangs from the arch of the stone
roof and accurately placed, at the exact center of the top of the
entrance, is a huge boulder in the shape of a keystone, set there by
the Architect of all the earth many thousands of years ago."</p>

<p>No one can describe the beautiful shapes and designs to be
found in the caverns. They must be seen to be appreciated fully
and no matter how many caves one has seen, he will not regret
the magic time spent here.</p>

<h2><a name="Luray" id="Luray"></a>Luray</h2>


<p>The question is often asked as to the origin of the unusual
name of the town of Luray. Legend disagrees as to its derivation.
There are some who claim it came from the name of an early
settler, Lewis Ramey. He was familiarly known as Lew Ramey
and the contraction Lew Ray might have followed naturally.
The site of Ramey's little log cabin is at the corner of Main and
Court streets.</p>

<p>Some citizens of the town insist that the Huguenots who escaped
from France and finally migrated to the Valley named the new
settlement Lorraine after their province in France and that Luray
is a corruption of the former name.</p>

<p>There are reminders near this town of former years of struggle.
During the French and Indian War the settlers decided upon
building "cellar forts" for protection against Indian raids. These
cellars dug under the log homes were large enough for living
quarters and were generally supplied with a spring of water.
They were so constructed with rocks serving as a ceiling that
even in case of fire in the house proper, the occupants of the
cellar would be unhurt. Several of these ingenious little fortifications
remain in Page County, Rhodes Fort and the Egypt House
being good examples of them.</p>

<p>In the Hawksbill neighborhood, not far from Luray, there
lived a long time ago John Stone and his family. In 1758 the
Indians came to his home while he was away. They had little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
difficulty in carrying off Mrs. Stone and her baby, a son about
eight years old and another boy, George Grandstaff, who was
sixteen.</p>

<p>The marauders sacked other residences in the neighborhood and
killed a number of persons. It is possible that when they set out
for their own settlements some distance off they found Mrs.
Stone's progress impeded because of carrying the baby. At any
rate, they murdered those two and continued on their way with
the boys.</p>

<p>Three years later Grandstaff escaped as their prisoner and
returned to Mr. Stone. Young Stone remained with the savages
for a number of years and when he did come home he sold his
father's property and with the money in his pockets he went
back to the Indian village. No one ever heard of him afterwards.</p>

<p>Luray was laid out in 1812 by William Staige Marye, son of
Peter Marye, who built the first turnpike&mdash;a toll-road&mdash;to cross
the Blue Ridge from Culpeper into the Shenandoah Valley. Near
Luray is the <a name="corr_6"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: Saltpeper">Saltpetre</ins> Cave. During the War Between the States
the Confederates established a nitrate plant there and used the
products in their manufacture of ammunition.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful drives in Virginia is that leaving
Luray, crossing the mountain and entering the Valley Pike at
New Market.</p>

<p>Of particular importance to this section are the Luray Caverns.
An entertaining history is attached to them. As far back as 1793
there was knowledge of the existence of the caves, for Joseph
Ruffner's son had explored several passages just about this time.
Ruffner's property took on the name of Cave Hill.</p>

<p>The Ruffners were among the largest landowners in the Valley,
their property extending twelve miles on both sides of Hawksbill
Creek. They received a part of the land through inheritance and
bought other tracts. Dr. Henry Ruffner, a member of this distinguished
family, was at one time President of Washington
College, now Washington and Lee University at Lexington.</p>

<p>Fighting during the War Between the States occurred near the
town of Luray and about two miles south on the Lee Highway
there is an old oak tree which marks the place where Sheridan's
famous Valley ride was halted for a time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>There are interesting landmarks remaining in the town today
which have witnessed the pageant of history, among the most
pretentious being "Aventine." This home originally occupied the
present site of the Mymslyn Hotel.</p>

<h2><a name="Stonewall_Jacksons_Valley_Campaign" id="Stonewall_Jacksons_Valley_Campaign"></a>Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign</h2>


<p>Too much space must not be consumed in this book in presenting
the facts regarding Jackson's Valley Campaign. We feel
justified in devoting more than a comment to this notable feat of
war, however, for some of the heaviest fighting of the four years'
conflict took place on the land you may see in driving over the
Valley Pike and along the Skyline Drive.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities in the War Between the States
Thomas Jackson left the chair of higher mathematics at the Virginia
Military Institute and volunteered his services in the Virginia
army. Educated at West Point and trained during the
Mexican War he was a welcome addition to the Confederate
forces, although no one anticipated the <a name="corr_7"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: conspicious">conspicuous</ins> rôle he would
play in the subsequent events. At the early battle of First Manassas
he earned the name of "Stonewall" because of his quiet,
dignified and unafraid manner in the face of danger.</p>

<p>Lt. Col. C. F. R. Henderson's invaluable two volumes, <i>Stonewall
Jackson and the American Civil War</i>, were consulted and are
the source quoted hereafter in giving the account of the Valley
warfare. The First Brigade of the Virginia army was recruited
from the Valley and participated under Jackson in the first battle
of Manassas and for a long period of time thereafter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No better material for soldiers ever existed," said Henderson,
"than the men of the Valley. Most of them were of Scotch-Irish
descent, but from the more northern counties came many of English
blood, and from those in the center of Swiss and German. But whatever
their origin, they were thoroughly well qualified for their new
trade. All classes mingled in the ranks, and all ages; the heirs of the
oldest families, and the humblest of the sons of toil; boys whom it was
impossible to keep in school, and men whose white beards hung below
their cross belts; youths who had been reared in luxury, and rough
hunters from their lonely cabins. They were a mountain people, nurtured
in a wholesome climate bred to manly sports, and hardened by
the free life of the field and forest. To social distinctions they gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>little heed. They were united for a common purpose; they had taken
arms to defend Virginia and to maintain her rights; and their
patriotism was proved by the sacrifice of all personal consideration and
individual interest."</p></div>

<p>After the first battle of Manassas the First Brigade was known
as the "Stonewall Brigade."</p>

<p>From July to November, 1861, Jackson spent the greater part
of every day drilling the men under him and in trying to convert
them into well-disciplined, obedient troops. During the first
week in November he was sent from Manassas to command the
Shenandoah Valley district and this meant parting from the
soldiers whom he had reason to admire and who in turn held
him in highest esteem. A short time later they were destined to
reunite under circumstances which would try the courage of the
brigade and commander. To the delight of all, the Stonewall
Brigade was assigned to Winchester soon after Jackson established
his headquarters there and for the next few months rigid training
was given them again.</p>

<p>About the middle of March 1862, Jackson abandoned Winchester.
This was after some of the Union concentration near Manassas
and Centreville was broken up and General Banks made no
move to offer battle, so the Confederates withdrew without a
fight and occupied Strasburg eighteen or twenty miles southward.
The evacuation of Winchester was made reluctantly, for good
roads in each direction connected the city with outlying districts,
fertile farms nearby could furnish the invading army with rations
and Banks could receive from or send troops to West Virginia
or the army south of Washington. Feeling that Jackson's small
force was not of any special danger, Shields' corps was sent in
pursuit of the Confederates and most of Banks' troops were
ordered to another field. Jackson continued up the Valley and
stopped at Mount Jackson, hoping the Federals would follow.</p>

<p>The Confederate general learned from Ashby, his cavalry
commander, that the enemy was retreating. It was Lee's intention
that the Union corps in the Valley be retained there so that
assistance could not be offered McClellan, the Northern general
who was maneuvering in the eastern part of Virginia with the
ultimate aim of striking Richmond. McClellan hoped to attack
the capital of the Confederacy by combining his army with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of McDowell, whom he could call to the area of war when necessary.
So it was to be Jackson's duty to keep them in the Valley
and perhaps to withdraw some of the Northern troops from
near Richmond.</p>

<p>On March 22nd Ashby with his troopers and a few guns engaged
Shields in a skirmish just south of Winchester. He believed
there was only a small force of Federals present, so well had
Shields hidden his men, and he reported to Jackson that the
troops were small in number. The next day Jackson sent reinforcements
to Ashby and then followed later with his whole
force in the direction of Kernstown which is south of Winchester
and but a short distance off. There the battle of Kernstown
began and continued until dark. Jackson's troops were defeated
and retreated southward. As a result of this encounter Shields
was reinforced and the strong Union force remained in the Valley.</p>

<p>The Federal generals were apparently satisfied with the victory
and in spite of urgings from the Secretary of War, Stanton, to
pursue Jackson they remained inactive for nearly a month.</p>

<p>Banks assumed the offensive on April 17th, and surprised
Ashby, taking one of his companies prisoner. The Virginians
burned the railroad station at Mount Jackson and fell back while
the Union cavalry established themselves at New Market.</p>

<p>The Confederate General Ewell had a force of 8,000 men on
the Upper Rappahannock which is some distance east of the mountains.
This corps was left at its location in order to rush to the
defense of Fredericksburg or Richmond or across the mountains
to the Valley. Jackson knew that he must not allow Banks to
control the mountain pass, thus severing communication between
the two Confederate forces. He determined upon a forced march
for his men and on the eighteenth they reached Harrisonburg.
He continued over to Swift Run Gap and encamped near there.</p>

<p>Banks followed his cavalry to New Market, crossed over to
Luray and seized the bridges, driving back a detachment of
Jackson's men sent there to defend them. Later he sent two of
his five brigades to Harrisonburg and the rest stayed at New
Market.</p>

<p>Jackson's next move was to McDowell, a town about twenty-seven
miles northwest of Harrisonburg. The march was made in
the most circuitous manner: from Swift Run Gap to Port Repub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>lic,
to Brown's Gap which is about twelve miles southeast of
their camp at Elk Run Valley, to Staunton and then west to
McDowell. This strategy was used so that he might deceive
Banks, Fremont and Milroy, the Federal commanders in and near
the Valley, into thinking for a while that he was leaving the
Valley to join forces at Richmond. Jackson proposed to strike
each Union force located in this section of Virginia but he believed
an encounter with Milroy commanding the weakest corps
should be made before attacking Banks. The Battle of McDowell
occurred on May 8th, and was a victory for Jackson. He followed
the enemy in their retreat as far as Franklin. A squadron of
Ashby's cavalry spent much time in blocking any of the passes
which Fremont might use in crossing the mountains to reinforce
Banks. Bridges were burned and rocks and trees were placed
across the roadways. Jackson's object was thus thoroughly
achieved:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All combination between the Federal columns, except by long
and devious routes, had now been rendered impracticable; and there
was little fear that in any operations down the Valley his own communications
would be endangered. The McDowell expedition had
neutralized, for the time being, Fremont's 20,000 men; and Banks was
now isolated, exposed to the combined attack of Jackson, Ewell and
Edward Johnson."</p></div>

<p>Ewell in the meantime had left his post near Gordonsville and
had moved into Swift Run Gap in order to go to Jackson if
necessary. After the Battle of McDowell, Jackson returned to the
Valley. Lee ordered him to make a movement against Banks as
speedily as possible, to drive him towards Washington and appear
ready to attack the Union capital. Thus he hoped to see some of
the Northerners leave the vicinity of Richmond and return to
defend their capital.</p>

<p>Jackson entered the Valley at Mount Solon and pushed northward
at once. Banks erected earthworks at Strasburg and considered
himself well entrenched against the enemy. Ewell, with
his Confederates, left Swift Run Gap and moved to Luray. Jackson
moved north to New Market. The Confederates now organized
into two divisions, Jackson's and Ewell's, numbering about
17,000 men. The troops under Jackson instead of continuing
northward in their march turned east and crossed the Massanutten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Mountain and headed north. On May 22nd the advanced guard
camped within ten miles of Front Royal. This town was "held
by a strong detachment of Banks' small army."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Since they had left Mount Solon and Elk Run Valley on May
19th the troops in four days had made just sixty miles. Such celerity
of movement was unfamiliar to both Banks and Stanton, and on the
night of the 22nd neither the Secretary nor the General had the
faintest suspicion that the enemy had as yet passed Harrisonburg....
There was serenity at Washington.... The Secretary, ... saw no
reason for alarm. His strategical combinations were apparently working
without a hitch.... Milroy's defeat was considered no more than
an incident of 'la petite guerre'. Washington seemed so perfectly
secure that the recruiting offices had been closed, and the President and
Secretary, anticipating the immediate fall of Richmond, left for Fredericksburg
the next day. McDowell was to march on the 26th, and the
departure of his fine army was to be preceded by a grand review....</p>

<p>"So on this night of May 22nd the President and his people were
without fear of what the morrow might bring forth. The end of the
rebellion seemed near at hand. Washington was full of the anticipated
triumph. The crowds passed to and fro exchanging congratulations on
the success of the Northern arms and the approaching downfall of the
slaveholders.... Little dreamt the light-hearted multitude that, in the
silent woods of the Luray Valley, a Confederate army lay asleep beneath
the stars. Little dreamt Lincoln, or Banks, or Stanton, that not
more than seventy miles from Washington, and less than thirty from
Strasburg, the most daring of the enemies, waiting for the dawn to
rise above the mountains was pouring out his soul in prayer."</p></div>

<p>Banks' 10,000 men were distributed in this manner: at Strasburg
the largest contingent, at Winchester a small group of
infantry and cavalry, with two companies of infantry at Newtown,
midway between Strasburg and Front Royal. At Rectortown,
nineteen miles east of Front Royal was General Geary with
2,000 infantry and cavalry independent of Banks. Front Royal
was held by Colonel Kenly of the First Maryland Regiment,
U. S. A. On the morning of May 23rd the Confederates struck
Kenly's small force. Every line of communication and reinforcement
had been severed during the previous night and "within an
hour after his pickets were surprised Kenly was completely
isolated."</p>

<p>Banks moved north from Strasburg towards Winchester before
Jackson could scatter his troops along the route and cut off his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
retreat. Encounters took place at Newtown and Middletown and
Kernstown during the early morning of May 24th. The battle of
Winchester occurred the following day. Particularly hard fighting
was done by both sides, but the surprise movements of Jackson
during the past few days, the partial demoralization of the Union
forces and the keen fighting of the Confederate divisions drove
Banks' army from Winchester and on to Martinsburg.</p>

<p>Lee sent instructions to Jackson to threaten an invasion of
Maryland and an attack upon Washington at this excellent time.
So on the 28th the Stonewall Brigade set out towards Harper's
Ferry and at Charlestown they met a Federal force, routing them
within twenty minutes. Ewell came up to support the Brigade
and on the 29th the army of the Valley was encamped near
Halltown. The greater part of the Federals crossed the Potomac
River at Harper's Ferry. Jackson, however, learned that the
Union soldiers were advancing to cut off his retreat; Shields'
division was approaching Manassas Gap and Fremont had left
Franklin and was about ten miles from Moorefield. Jackson felt
that Lee's orders had been carried out and decided to retreat
along the Valley Pike. The Southerners turned southward towards
Winchester. En route Jackson found out that the small force
left at Front Royal had been driven back and that Shields occupied
the town. The Valley army was ordered to Strasburg, the
First Brigade was called back from Charlestown, the prisoners
and supplies were picked up at Winchester and moved southward.
"From the morning of May 19 to the night of June 1, a
period of fourteen days, the Army of the Valley had marched
one hundred and seventy miles, had routed a force of 12,500 men,
had threatened the North with invasions, had drawn off McDowell
from Fredericksburg, had seized the hospitals and supply
depots at Front Royal, Winchester, and Martinsburg, and finally,
although surrounded on three sides by 60,000 men, had brought
off a huge convoy without losing a single wagon."</p>

<p>When the Federals learned that Jackson had moved south
Shields was sent towards Luray from Front Royal. Fremont
moved towards Woodstock. The Federal cavalry reached Luray
on June 2nd and found that the enemy had already been there and
burned the bridges, thus cutting off their approach to New
Market. A part of the Confederates were repulsed on June 2nd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
between Strasburg and Woodstock and the skirmishing continued
the next day with the Confederates retreating to Mount Jackson
and burning the bridges over the North Fork of the Shenandoah
River. The Union troops tried to construct their pontoons across
the stream but a driving rain and high waters prevented their
doing so. This failure gave the rebels a day's respite.</p>

<p>Jackson with his force passed from Harrisonburg over to Cross
Keys and there bivouacked. The Northern generals looked upon
this move as a retreat.</p>

<p>On June 8th and 9th the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic
took place, victories for the Southerners. The Confederates
moved on to Brown's Gap, a point a bit nearer Richmond. "The
success which the Confederates had achieved was undoubtedly
important. The Valley army, posted at Brown's Gap, was now in
direct communication with Richmond. Not only had its pursuers
been roughly checked, but the sudden and unexpected counter-stroke,
delivered by an enemy whom they believed to be in full
flight, had surprised Lincoln and Stanton as effectively as Shields
and Fremont."</p>

<p>Thus the plan of McClellan to fall upon Richmond had been
postponed and a division of the Northern forces was made necessary
to protect the Federal capital and to supply Banks with troops.</p>

<p>Later in the month Jackson's division moved with great secrecy
to join General Lee near Richmond&mdash;but that is a story for
another time.</p>

<p>"In a pretty storied house, the walls completely covered by roses
and honeysuckle in luxuriant bloom" according to Belle Boyd
herself, lived one of the most beautiful women and one of the
most famous spies in all history.</p>

<p>Martinsburg, her home in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley,
was only a village then and she tells us about her neighbors and
her childhood&mdash;"It was all golden and I was surrounded by
devoted and beloved parents and brothers and sisters ... our
neighbors are some of the best families of the Old Dominion
descended from such ancestors as the Fairfaxes and Washingtons."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>When Belle was only twelve she was sent to Mount Washington
Seminary in Washington. At sixteen her education was
finished and she made her début. She wrote how brilliant were
the Congressional and Senate balls where both Northern and
Southern belles met and learned to love each other as sisters.</p>

<p>Then came the dark days of Secession. Belle's own father was
among the first to enlist in the defense of Virginia. Belle returned
home where with other ladies she helped raise funds with
which to equip the Confederate soldiers. The colors were raised
and on them one read these words, "Our God, Our Country and
Our Women."</p>

<p>Things were dull for Belle after her father and the boys
marched away to Harper's Ferry. Soon she went to visit them
where she enjoyed the social life until messages came saying the
Federal troops were approaching. She was sent home and scarcely
had she arrived before the Southern troops withdrew to Falling
Waters, near her home. She heard the distant boom of cannon
and quickly there followed the battle of Martinsburg. After a
skirmish of five hours, Belle saw General Jackson's troops retreat.</p>

<p>Hard upon them were the Federals entering the village with
flags flying and the fifes playing the now despised "Yankee
Doodle."</p>

<p>Dawned the Fourth of July and Belle woke to see the Yankee
flags flying from many homes. She heard the drunken soldiers as
they planned to force their way into homes whose doors and
blinds were shut tight. Blows began to batter down doors and
those of the Boyd home were splintered as well as those of their
neighbors.</p>

<p>Some one had told the Federals that the walls of Belle's room
were covered with rebel flags. But though they searched none
were found. Belle's Negro maid had taken them down and carefully
hidden them. The soldiers were furious and began to break
furniture, glass ornaments, and abuse the Virginia sympathizers.
Then they went out and began to raise the United States flag over
the Boyd home. This was more than Mrs. Boyd could stand, so
she spoke: "Men, every member of my household will die before
that flag shall be raised over us." Let us read Belle's account of
what followed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Upon this, one of the soldiers, thrusting himself forward addressed
my mother in language so offensive as it is impossible to conceive.
I could stand it no longer, my indignation was aroused beyond control,
my blood was literally boiling in my veins, I drew out my pistol and
shot him. He was carried away mortally wounded and soon after he
expired."</p></div>

<p>Then the Boyd home was set on fire, but it was hastily put out.
The Northern commander quickly arrived and an investigation
followed. After a long and lengthy trial, during which time the
Boyd home was guarded by sentries, the officer declared Belle
had acted as any normal person would have under similar
circumstances.</p>

<p>From this time on, Belle gave herself to the Confederate Cause.
She met and charmed the Federal officers. She remembered their
names and got them to tell her their plans. These Belle carefully
wrote down and sent to General J. E. B. Stuart. Soon she was
under suspicion and one of her letters was seized by the enemy.
She was sent for, arrested and asked if she had written the letter.
She acknowledged it, was rebuked and the Articles of War regarding
such deeds were read to her. Again a trial&mdash;and a
dismissal.</p>

<p>Belle was undaunted. She not only continued to pick up
valuable information, but she picked up small side arms and
pistols and these, along with the information, found their way into
the Southern lines.</p>

<p>While on a visit to Front Royal the first battle of Manassas
was fought. The wounded were rushed into Front Royal and
Belle found herself the matron of the large hospital. Soldiers
told how she worked night and day, tirelessly giving of herself
to comfort and help "the boys." After eight weeks of such a
strenuous life, Belle had to go home for a much needed rest.</p>

<p>Before her mother thought she was strong enough, Belle left
to visit her father who was stationed at Manassas. Soon she was
riding as a courier back and forth for General Jackson and General
Beauregard.</p>

<p>On one occasion Belle was in Front Royal waiting for an
opportunity to go to Richmond where her family had gone. She
had secured passes from some of her Federal friends and she was
staying in the same house in which General Shields was stopping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Belle's room was over the living-room where the officers were
making plans. A small hole in the closet floor gave her a good
view of the men&mdash;and served to let her hear every word of their
next maneuvers. Belle listened until one o'clock, writing down in
cypher each plan. Then she carefully stole down the back steps,
saddled a horse in the backyard and was off, fifteen miles, to
carry the message.</p>

<p>Twice she was held up by Federal sentinels and twice she
showed them Federal passes. She arrived safely back in Front
Royal before day, as fresh as a "morning flower."</p>

<p>We cannot give all of her escapades or her narrow escapes.
Once she sped through Front Royal with a message for General
Jackson, her white sun bonnet and white apron against a blue
dress making her a target for the Federals. Several times she felt
bullets tear her wide billowing skirt, but she kept on until she
had reached the General&mdash;giving him the position of the enemy:
General Banks, at Strasburg with 4,000 troops, General White
marching to Winchester and General Fremont approaching the
Valley&mdash;all planning to "bottle up" Jackson's force.</p>

<p>Quickly the Confederates made plans which resulted in victory
and General Jackson wrote her, "Miss Belle Boyd&mdash;I thank you
for myself and for the Army for the immense service that you
have rendered your country this day. Hastily your friend, T. J.
Jackson, C. S. A."</p>

<p>Romance like danger courted her wherever she was. Finally in
1864 she decided to go to England. President Davis gave her
important papers for Southern sympathizers there. She sailed
from Wilmington, North Carolina, aboard the "Greyhound."
Vivid pictures are given of the crew throwing overboard bales of
cotton, but even this did not enable the ship to outrun the fast
Union vessels. Captain Bier also dropped a keg of money, over
thirty thousand dollars in gold, in order to lighten the cargo.
When Belle saw they could not avoid capture she destroyed her
dispatch and managed to put into a belt many gold dollars which
belonged to her and the captain of the boat. Let us read her
description of the Federal officer who said he must take over
command of the "Greyhound":<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I confess my attention was riveted by a gentleman&mdash;the first
whom I had met in my hour of distress. His dark brown hair
hung down on his shoulders, his eyes were large and bright.
Those who judge beauty by regularity of feature would not
only have pronounced him strictly handsome, but the fascination
of his manner was such that my heart yielded." He begged Belle
to consider herself still a passenger, rather than a prisoner, which
evidently she did.</p>

<p>There was a moon, a soft breeze "which swept the surface of
the ocean until it was like a vast bed of sparkling diamonds."
Lieutenant Hardinge, the Federal officer, quoted poetry from
Shakespeare and Byron and before the vessel reached Boston,
Belle had given her heart and her promise to marry the lieutenant.</p>

<p>While their own course of true love seemed to run smoothly
enough various forces concentrated to keep them apart.</p>

<p>First of all, soon after arriving in Boston Captain Bier escaped.
And while Belle took the credit for that, Lieutenant Hardinge
was under suspicion. Besides, while Belle was being treated
courteously in Boston her betrothed had gone to Washington in
her behalf. The newspapers of the day flaunted the stories of
the beautiful Rebel Spy and everywhere she went great crowds
pushed themselves upon her.</p>

<p>When Hardinge reached Washington he begged Gideon
Welles, Secretary of the Navy, permission for Miss Boyd to visit
Canada. This was granted and a telegram ordered an escort for
her and her maid. However, notice was given her that if she
were caught again in the United States she would be shot.</p>

<p>Her lover was captured next and arrested for aiding Captain
Bier in escaping. Finally, he went to Paris in search of the
beautiful woman who had promised to marry him. After some
time Belle, who was in Liverpool, learned where he was. She
wrote to him and they met in London; they were married in St.
James' Church. There was a large and brilliant breakfast at
which a huge wedding cake was cut. Lieutenant Hardinge promised
to run the blockade and carry pieces of wedding cake to his
wife's friends. This he did when he arrived in Wilmington.
Later he was arrested in Baltimore, charged with being a deserter
and was sent to prison.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Belle interested herself in his behalf and we are told that her
charms and the termination of the war secured his release. And
so they lived happily ever after!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the foregoing account of the fearless work done by Belle
Boyd and of her visit to Front Royal during the Battle of
Manassas we are reminded of an inhabitant of the latter place, a
Mr. McLean. Rumor has it that the gentleman resided so close
to the scene of battle&mdash;and it was a bloody encounter&mdash;he resolved
to quit the place for a quieter section of Virginia. He
had a distinct distaste for battles and bloodshed. So he moved
his family to Appomattox County in Virginia and watched the
scene of war with a feeling of comparative safety. The reader
has guessed the rest of the story.</p>

<p>A little previous to April 9th, 1865 the Union and Confederate
forces met at a spot not far from the courthouse and negotiations
were started for the surrender of General Lee, in command of
the Confederates. And on the ninth the surrender was made at
the McLean house which marked the cessation of war in Virginia.
Poor Mr. McLean was present at the beginning and
conclusion of the fighting!</p>

<h2><a name="Harrisonburg" id="Harrisonburg"></a>Harrisonburg</h2>


<p>Harrisonburg is called the Friendly City and its people are
noted for their hospitality. It is near famous caverns and historic
battlefields. It was named in honor of Thomas Harrison who had
fifty acres of his land surveyed and laid out into lots and streets.
It might also be called the center of a large German element
whose forefathers settled much of the surrounding country.
Harrisonburg is the county-seat of Rockingham county, which was
formed from Augusta in 1778. This is the third largest county
in Virginia.</p>

<p>These people have always been among the sturdiest and
bravest in the Valley. They gave the best they had to develop
their new homes in a new country and when they were called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
upon to fight in the French and Indian War, there were no
braver men to be had nor could any endure more hardships
than they.</p>

<p>During the Revolutionary War they were among the first to
respond to the call for volunteers. They were among the first to
resent the closing of the Boston Harbor by the British in 1774.
We read an old account or notation of Felix Gilbert who kept a
shop near the town of Harrisonburg. He agreed to take food-stuffs
from his neighbors and send it to the relief of the Bostonians.
One of those entries, made in 1775, reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Rece'd for the Bostonians; Of Patrick Frazier 1 bushel of wheat,
of Jos. Dictom 2 bushels of wheat, of James Beard 1 bu. of wheat,
Geo. Clarke 1 bu. wheat, Robt. Scott and Sons, 2 bu. wheat."</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Massanutten Caverns</span></h3>

<p>The owners of the Massanutten Caverns call them the "gem of
the cavern world," for they are a combination of the beautiful
and the unusual. They are located east of Harrisonburg on the
Spotswood Trail.</p>

<p>These caverns are of rather recent discovery. In 1892 during a
thriving limestone industry some workmen blasted rock in the
foothills and after the discharge of dynamite was over they looked
into a fairyland of strange rooms and strange formations.</p>

<p>The operator of the caverns called the entrance "Discovery
Gate" and planned the route through the underground so that
visitors begin their journey where the discovery was made.</p>

<p>Vacationists find themselves unloading their luggage and remaining
either overnight or for longer periods of time when they
see the facilities offered there. The accommodations include a
golf course and swimming pool as well as a lodge and cottages.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Grand Caverns</span></h3>

<p>Back in 1804 Bernard Weyer discovered the unusual caves
situated on a bluff belonging to his neighbor Mr. Mohler. Nearly
a century before, the courageous "Sir Knights of the Golden
Horseshoe" had passed by this part of the Blue Ridge&mdash;within ten
miles of the entrance of the caverns, perhaps, and because of the
layout of the land never suspected the underground "Buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
City." Today these are called Grand Caverns and are located
between Elkton and Mt. Sidney, the latter town being on the
Lee-Jackson Highway.</p>

<p>Young Weyer was a great hunter who enjoyed roaming the
fields and hillsides in search of game. The historian Kercheval
tells the story of the day when Weyer went to find an elusive
ground-hog, having previously set a trap for it. The animal not
only had not been captured but for some time had made a successful
getaway with each trap set for it. Weyer decided to dig
for the ground-hog hide-out. "A few moments' labor brought
him to the antechamber of this stupendous cavern, where he
found his traps safely deposited." Not content with eleven pages
of flattering and minute descriptions of every passageway known
then, Kercheval used another page with "Note A" and "Note B"
which described later explorations. This makes interesting reading
for those who have either visited the Caverns or have not
had that privilege and plan to see them. In these accounts he
included Congress Hall, The Infernal Regions, Washington's
Hall, The Church, Jefferson's Hall and numerous others.</p>

<p><i>The Historical Collections of Virginia</i> by Henry Howe gives a
vivid picture of Weyer's Cave and the author further states:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A foreign traveller who visited the cave at an annual illumination,
has, in a finely written description, the following notice:</p>

<p>" ... Weyer's Cave is in my judgment one of the great natural
wonders of this new world; and for its eminence in its own class,
deserves to be ranked with the Natural Bridge and Niagara, while it
is far less known than either.... For myself, I acknowledge the
spectacle to have been most interesting; but, to be so, it must be illuminated,
as on this occasion. I had thought that this circumstance might
give to the whole a toyish effect; but the influence of 2,000 or 3,000
lights on these immense caverns is only such as to reveal the objects,
without disturbing the solemn and sublime obscurity which sleeps on
everything. Scarcely any scenes can awaken so many passions at once,
and so deeply. Curiosity, apprehension, terror, surprise, admiration,
and delight, by turns and together, arrest and possess you. I have had
before, from other objects, one simple impression made with greater
power; but I never had so many impressions made, and with so much
power, before. If the interesting and the awful are the elements of the
sublime, here sublimity reigns, as in her own domain, in darkness,
silence, and deeps profound."</p></div>

<p>Bear in mind that this account was given long before 1850
and that Grand Caverns was first known as Weyer's Cave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>We learned that the Cave was used as a source of income by
its owners first in 1836, when the large chambers were converted
into temporary dance halls for the countryside youth. Mentioned
above is the fact that the caverns were lighted once a year and
admission was charged on this occasion. About 1925 the passages
were lighted properly and tourists began their trek to this wonder
of nature.</p>

<p>A modern note is to be found in the name "Linbergh Bridge"&mdash;one
not mentioned as such by any of the early writers!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Massanetta Springs</span></h3>

<p>One of the most delightful places in all the Valley is Massanetta
Springs. It is one of those beauty spots which one finds
after going through Swift Run Gap, famous for being the first
gap through which came the English with Governor Spotswood
and his Knights of the Golden Horseshoe. It was through here,
too, that General George Washington passed on horseback in
1784.</p>

<p>Long ago these springs were known as Taylor Springs and
during the War Between the States the wounded soldiers were
cared for there. Many famous people lived in and around this
lovely spring. We are told that Daniel Boone's wife lived near
here, and that Abraham Lincoln's father, Thomas Lincoln, was
born not more than twelve miles away on Linville Creek. Not far
away is Singer's Glen where some of the first early American
hymns and songs were published.</p>

<p>Today various religious denominations hold summer conferences
at the Springs.</p>

<h2><a name="Staunton" id="Staunton"></a>Staunton</h2>


<p>Near Lewis's Fort a settlement grew up and in 1749 a town
was chartered. It was named Staunton in honor of Lady Staunton,
wife of Governor Gooch, the official who had given so many
land grants to Lewis and his Scotch neighbors. At that time, the
town was the county-seat of Augusta (formed from Orange
County in 1738), whose boundaries swept far to the west. Old
records show that one time the court adjourned in Staunton and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
reconvened at Fort Duquesne, the colonial outpost which has long
since become Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>If one would search further, he would find this was done during
the French and Indian troubles. Five Chiefs, or rather several
of the Five Nations, signed this order or treaty and it is to be
seen among other historical documents in the Court House in
Staunton.</p>

<p>After the Legislature fled from Charlottesville to Staunton
during Tarleton's Raid, that body met and held its sessions in
old Trinity Episcopal Church. During this short time, Staunton
was called "the Capital of Virginia."</p>

<p>The area around Staunton is full of War Between the States
history too, referred to in other places.</p>

<p>Woodrow Wilson was born here in a lovely old Presbyterian
manse which is now a shrine to one of the greatest Presidents of
the United States. Here, annually, thousands of Americans come
to honor him.</p>

The town is a center of culture, for there are located many
splendid schools; among them, for girls are Mary Baldwin and
Stuart Hall. Staunton Military Academy and nearby Augusta
Military Academy are recognized as outstanding schools for boys.
There are two business schools, Dunsmore and Templeton Business
College. The one for the deaf and blind is a State institution.</p>

<p>Tarleton entered Charlottesville on the fourth day of June in
1781. Jefferson's term as governor expired four days later. Ex-Governor
Patrick Henry had been his guest while the Legislature
was meeting there. He now hastened to Staunton where the
Legislators had fled from Charlottesville. Mr. Jefferson, according
to one historian, concealed himself in a cave in Carter's Mountain
and Patrick Henry, in his flight to Staunton, met Colonel Lewis
and told him of how the Legislators had fled Charlottesville upon
Tarleton's invasion.</p>

<p>Colonel Lewis, not knowing who Patrick Henry was, replied
"If Patrick Henry had been in Albemarle, the British Dragoons
never would have passed over the Rivanna River."</p>

<p>The Legislators were badly demoralized, for they feared Tarleton
would come to Staunton. Many of them left during the night
and went to the hospitable home of Colonel George Moffett.
During Mr. Henry's hasty changes he had the misfortune to lose
one of his boots. While eating breakfast the next morning, Mrs.
Moffett remarked, "There was one member of the Legislative
body whom I knew would not run." The question was asked by
one of the party, "Who is he?" Her reply was, "Patrick Henry,"
at that moment a gentleman with one boot colored perceptibly.
The party soon left and after their departure a servant rode up
and asked for Mr. Henry, saying he had forgotten his boot. Of
course Mrs. Moffett knew whom the boot fitted.</p>

<p>A tale made more popular perhaps because of a recent revival
of interest in Salem witchcraft is that of a woman who lived years
ago in Augusta County and who was a great aunt of Governor
James McDowell of Rockbridge County. She was born Mary
McDowell and married James Greenlee.</p>

<p>It is recounted that she was an unusually attractive and intelligent
young woman but was considered highly eccentric in her behavior.
Neighbors thought that an early love affair had contributed
something to her peculiar manner. Be that as it may, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
was regarded by her acquaintances as a witch. They believed she
had made a written contract with the devil&mdash;a contract drawn up
in duplicate form so that each party might retain a copy!</p>

<p>Once at a quilting party in her home she urged one of the
quilters to take a second piece of cake and laughingly remarked
that "the mare that does double work should be best fed." The
women misconstrued this to be an acknowledgment that she was a
witch who rode a mare at night on her excursions to meet the
devil. The rumor of her evil activities rapidly spread throughout
the countryside.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

The neighborhood thought she was capable of placing curses
upon them and attributed such tragedies as fires, loss of family or
stock, or poor crops to the unfortunate woman.</p>

<p>The fact that she was never brought before the court with the
accusation of being a witch was due in large measure to the
standing of the family. That does not mean, however, that Mrs.
Greenlee did not live a wretched existence or that failure to
declare her a witch made the people less afraid of her powers.</p>

<p>While he was President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson
returned to Staunton and placed a tablet on the wall of the First
Presbyterian Church in memory of his father, Dr. Joseph Wilson,
a former minister. The church in which Dr. Wilson used to
preach and in which the President was christened serves now as
the Chapel of Mary Baldwin College.</p>

<p>An interesting old home in Staunton is the Stuart House, located
on Lewis Street. It was planned by the great architect and
builder Thomas Jefferson. Mr. A. H. Stuart, the owner, was a
member of President Fillmore's Cabinet.</p>

<p>The main building of the School for the Deaf and Blind is an
unexcelled example of Doric architecture. During the War Between
the States it was used as a hospital.</p>

<h2><a name="Waynesboro_and_Afton" id="Waynesboro_and_Afton"></a>Waynesboro and Afton</h2>


<p>"Mad Anthony Wayne," the Revolutionary hero, has a town
named for him in Virginia&mdash;Waynesboro. This is a beautiful
place which has become even more popular upon completion of
the projected Skyline Drive southward from Swift Run Gap.</p>

<p>The State Conservation Commission has erected an historical
marker which states briefly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here on one of the first roads west of the Blue Ridge, a hamlet
stood in colonial times. The Walker exploring expedition started from
this vicinity in 1748. Here, in June 1781, the Augusta militia assembled
to join Lafayette in the East. A town was founded in 1797. It
was established by law in 1801 and named for General Anthony
Wayne."</p></div>

<p>In 1854 the countryside was very much excited over the trip
made by the first train travelling west of the Blue Ridge. Crowds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
gathered to see the phenomenon and half of them left in fright,
we are told, as the iron horse chugged off. Incidentally, mules
hauled the first passenger engine over the high mountains and
set it down for its memorable exodus.</p>

<p>For the most part the buildings one sees in the town have been
erected since 1861, for in that year a devastating fire wiped out
the landmarks of pioneer days.</p>

<p>The last battle in Northern Virginia during the War Between
the States occurred here in March 1865, just about a month before
the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox. Hoping to protect
Rockfish Gap, General Early had his Confederate forces quartered
in the town. Sheridan, the Union General, surprised him and
captured more than half the rebels.</p>

<p>Furnishing power for the large manufacturing interests are the
numerous springs of Waynesboro, which have a capacity of millions
of gallons of water a day. If you are unfamiliar with springs
such as Virginia has, you should stop at Brunswick, Baker's, or
Basic Lithia Springs for an unusual sight.</p>

<p>Swannanoa, one of the finest estates in Virginia, is on top of
the mountain between Waynesboro and Afton. It is said by
numbers of people that two of the loveliest views in America
may be had from this point: Rockfish and Shenandoah <a name="corr_8"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original:valleys">valleys.</ins>
You will probably agree with the statement when you stand where
you may get a commanding view of the country below you. The
large home on the estate is now a country club. Nearby is the
site of "Old Mountain Top Tavern," widely known years ago for
its fine hospitality. A group met at the tavern in 1818 to decide
the location of the proposed University of Virginia. Among them
were Madison, Monroe, Marshall and Jefferson.</p>

<p>Driving along the roads you see some of the finest peach
orchards in Virginia, for the section is famed for its high quality
fruit. Not only do peaches abound here, but you will also see
splendid apple orchards. If you happen along at the right season
you will be able to stop at a roadside market to buy the renowned
Albemarle Pippins&mdash;the apples which are grown for miles around&mdash;and
some of the luscious peaches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Natural_Bridge" id="Natural_Bridge"></a>Natural Bridge</h2>


<p>"Who first discovered Natural Bridge?" is a question which
nearly every one asks, and a second one is, "How high is it?"</p>

<p>The answer to the first is given in an old Indian legend which
reads something like this: Long, long ago, years before the
Princess Pocahontas saved the life of Captain John Smith, there
was a terrible war between some of the tribes. The Shawnees
were noted for their cruelty and they joined forces with the
Powhatans. They roamed through Virginia and fell upon the
Monocans, a more friendly tribe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-089.jpg" width="400" height="673" alt="Natural Bridge" title="Natural Bridge" />
<p class="caption">Natural Bridge</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
There had been a famine that year and the Monocans were
weakened by hunger and many of their braves fell in battle. After
a long conflict, the Monocans decided to retreat and they gave way
before the enemy. But they were pursued relentlessly. The
Monocans sought refuge in a strange forest and suddenly they
came upon a high chasm, whose steep walls were of rock. The
braves peered over and were made dizzy when they saw the great
distance to the bottom below, where a swiftly running river
looked like a small silver ribbon.</p>

<p>Even the strongest could not have jumped across the wide
chasm, for it was over a hundred feet wide. Their swiftest scouts
ran hither and yon, but each brought back word that there was
no way around.</p>

<p>The Monocans were in despair and in their distress threw
themselves upon the ground and cried aloud to the Great Spirit
to spare their lives from the approaching enemy.</p>

<p>One of the braves arose and went again to the edge of the
cliff. He stared down at his feet, then turned and shouted, "Our
prayers have been granted us&mdash;The Great Spirit has built for us
a bridge across the great abyss."</p>

<p>"Be careful," cried one of the men. "Send the squaws and
children first to test it. If they cross in safety, then we will know
it will be heavy enough to carry our weight also."</p>

<p>And so the women and children passed over into the shelter
of the forest beyond. Even as they went they could hear the war
whoops of the advancing enemy.</p>

<p>But the Monocans were refreshed in spirit. Their courage had
returned, for was not the Great Spirit on their side? The braves
quickly took positions on the bridge, each feeling he stood on
sacred ground, and like the Greeks of old at Thermopylae they
turned and faced their enemy and fought victoriously. From that
day, we are told, they called it "The Bridge of God" and worshipped
it.</p>

<p>The first white man to own Natural Bridge was Thomas
Jefferson, and one may see the original land grant still hanging
on the walls of Monticello which reads, in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Know ye that for divers good causes and considerations, but more
Especially for and in Consideration of the sum of Twenty Shillings of
good and lawful money for our use paid to our Receiver General of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
our Revenues, in this our Colony and Dominion of Virginia, We have
Given, Granted and Confirmed, and by these presents for us, our
heirs and successors, Do give, Grant and confirm unto Thomas
Jefferson, one certain Tract or parcel of land, containing 157 acres,
lying and being in the County of Botetourt, including the Natural
Bridge on Cedar Creek, a branch of James River ..."</p></div>

<p>We are told that George Washington surveyed the land in
1750, and while there he climbed up 23 feet and carved his
initials "G. W." on the southeast walls; the guide today will
try to point them out to the visitor. A story is also told that
George Washington threw a stone from the bottom of Cedar
Creek over the Bridge. Evidently he liked to test his strength by
such sports, for it is said that he threw a Spanish dollar across the
Rappahannock River opposite the town of Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>When this story was told to the late President Cleveland, he
replied, "I do not know about that, but I am well assured he
threw a sovereign across the Atlantic."</p>

<p>In 1927 another stone was found which scientists think proved
George Washington surveyed that territory. This stone is a large
one and also bears his initials which are engraved in a surveyor's
cross. Evidently he measured the height of the Bridge by dropping
a line from the edge of the bridge to the cross below.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson called his purchase the "most Sublime of
Nature's works." He visited it many times and during his presidency,
in 1802, he surveyed the place with his own hands. He
later built a log cabin which contained two rooms and one of them
was always kept ready for a visitor. Many famous people visited
there and the list includes such men as John Marshall, James
Monroe, Henry Clay, Sam Houston and Martin Van Buren.
While in France, Jefferson collected many plants and shrubs
which he sent to America; many of these were planted at the
Bridge, and some are still in <a name="corr_9"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: existance">existence</ins>.</p>

<p>Cedar Creek, the parent of the Bridge, has been busy for
thousands of years cutting a bit deeper each year.</p>

<p>The answer to the second question, "How high is it?," is found
on a Government bench which carries a brass plate, "1,150 feet
above the sea." It is 245 feet high and is 90 feet wide.</p>

<p>Boys and men are especially interested in the exciting story of
how Dr. Chester Reeds actually measured the wonderful Bridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
He had a special basket built which was strong enough to hold
him. Two hundred and fifty feet of rope was fastened to it and
run through a pulley and one end of it was tied to a fence post.
He was very dizzy at first and could not take pictures of the side
walls of the bridge. Gradually he became accustomed to turning
around and was able to get many fine ones at various angles and
of the massive supporting walls, the huge slabs of limestone and
some of the foliage.</p>

<p>Natural Bridge is a monument to the patience of Old Mother
Nature and her skill as an artist. Today, one wonders at the
deep gorge&mdash;by night, with modern electrification, one is spellbound
by its beauty&mdash;and when sweet music fills the glen with
its symphonies one's soul is lifted to the Greatest Artist of all&mdash;to
God in reverence and gratitude.</p>

<h2><a name="Rockbridge" id="Rockbridge"></a>Rockbridge</h2>


<p>Rockbridge County takes its name from the celebrated Natural
Bridge and was formed from Augusta and Botetourt counties. A
branch of the James River is called North River and this stream
waters the county, flowing diagonally across it. Some of the
richest soil in all the Valley is found in Rockbridge. Lexington,
which is the county-seat, takes its name from the town of Lexington
in Massachusetts and was founded in 1778. The first buildings
of the old town were mostly destroyed by fire in 1794 and
were replaced with substantial brick buildings. An Englishman
who was visiting America long ago described the little town in
these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The town as a settlement, has many attractions. It is surrounded
by beauty, and stands at the head of a valley flowing with milk and
honey. House rent is low, provisions are cheap, abundant and of the
best quality."</p></div>

<p>The settlers were mostly the Scotch-Irish and of the Presbyterian
faith. As soon as they had cleared the lands and built their
homes they planted orchards, built their barns and settled down.
These were thoughtful men and women who kept their emotions
under constant guard. Yet when occasion arose, they spoke simply
and clearly and were unafraid. They detested civil tyranny and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
as they were far away from the seat of government, to a certain
extent they made their own laws and rigidly adhered to them.</p>

<p>They were among the first in the Valley of Virginia to rally to
the defense of their country during the War of the Revolution.</p>

<p>In their moral life, they were almost Puritanical. This was
founded on religious principle and often they were considered
austere and stern. Yet those who knew them, felt the kindness
and devotion to which they did not give expressions in words. To
them, deeds meant more than promises. Though they reproved
one without a smile, their eyes often expressed understanding and
sympathy and the offending one felt the deep love which had
moved the other to speak&mdash;always for the good of the offender.
And while some other fault would rear its head, not often was
the offense repeated which had called forth the reproach.</p>

<p>The men and women were deeply religious and family prayers
were the first order of the day. As soon as homes were established
provisions were made for religious services to be held. Tiny
churches dotted the Valley wherever the Scotch-Irish settled. If
the church was far away, as it was from some, on meeting day
young and old mounted their horses and rode the intervening
miles for the long services.</p>

<p>Many of these old Presbyterian churches are still standing today
and they serve as monuments to that hardy race of men and
women who braved all for religious freedom and for civic liberty.
The building of these churches meant such labor as we of the
present generation cannot know. There were no roads and no
sawmills. An old historian tells us how one church was built:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The people of Providence Congregation packed all the sand used
in building their church from a place six miles distant, sack and sack,
on the backs of horses! And what is almost incredible, the fair wives
and daughters of the congregation are said to have undertaken this
part of the work, while the men labored at the stone and timber. Let
not the great-granddaughters of these women blush for them however
deeply they would blush themselves to be found in such employment.
For ourselves, we admire the conduct of these females; it was not only
excusable, but praiseworthy&mdash;it was almost heroic! It takes Spartan
mothers to rear Spartan men. These were among the women whose
sons and grandsons sustained Washington in the most disastrous period
of the Revolution."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>There was little social life in those early days such as their
eastern cousins knew along the James River. Except for their
church festivals, they did little entertaining. Twice a year they
held the Lord's Supper and this lasted for four days, with religious
services each day. During these times families living nearest the
church invited those who lived at great distances to stay with
them. Often some young couple would be married, either just
before or immediately after these services. Then there would be
a little merriment, extra cakes and a few playful pranks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The First Academy in the Valley</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Ruffner has left us a description of Timber Ridge, which
was built near Fairfield in Rockbridge County in 1776. The
school took its name from the fine oak trees which grew along its
ridge. He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The schoolhouse was a log cabin. The fine oak forest, which had
given Timber Ridge its name, cast its shade over it in summer and
afforded convenient fuel in winter. A spring of pure water gushed
from the rocks near the house. From amidst the trees the student had
a fine view of the country below and the neighboring Blue Ridge. In
short all the features of the place made it a fit habitation of the woodland
muse and the hill deserved the name of Mount Pleasant. Hither
about thirty youths of the mountains repaired to 'taste of the Pierian
spring.' Of reading, writing and ciphering, the boys of the country
had before acquired such knowledge as primary schools could afford;
but with a few late exceptions, Latin, Greek, algebra, geometry and
such like scholastic mysteries were things of which they had heard&mdash;which
they knew perhaps to lie covered up in the learned heads of
their pastors&mdash;but of the nature and uses they had no conception
whatever.</p>

<p>"It was a log hut of one room. The students carried their dinner
with them from the boarding-schools in the neighborhood. They
conned their lesson either in the schoolroom where the recitations
were heard, or under the shade of the trees where breezes whispered
and birds sang without disturbing their studies. A horn&mdash;perhaps a
cow's horn&mdash;summoned the school from play and scattered classes
to recitations.</p>

<p>"Instead of broadcloth coats, the students generally wore a far more
graceful garment, the hunting shirt, home-spun, home-woven, and
home-made, by the industry of wives and daughters.</p>

<p>"Their amusements were not less remote from the modern taste of
students&mdash;cards, backgammon, flutes, fiddles, and even marbles were
scarcely known among these mountain boys. Firing pistols and rang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>ing
the field with shotguns to kill little birds for sport, they would
have considered a waste of time and ammunition. As to frequenting
tippling shops of any denomination, that was impossible because no
such catchpenny lures for students existed in the country, or would
have been tolerated. Had any huckster of liquors, knicknacks, and
explosive crackers, hung out signs in those days, the old Puritan
morality of the land was yet vigorous enough to abate the nuisance.
The sports of the students were mostly gymnastic, both manly and
healthful&mdash;such as leaping, running, wrestling, pitching quoits and
playing ball. In this rustic seminary a considerable number of young
men began their education, who afterwards bore a distinguished part
in the civil and ecclesiastical affairs of the country."</p></div>

<h2><a name="Valley_Inventions" id="Valley_Inventions"></a>Valley Inventions</h2>


<p>The Valley of Virginia has often been termed "the granary
of the South." It is no wonder that farmers from time to time
have tried to shorten their labor in the wheat fields by inventing
machines to do their work.</p>

<p>The name Robert McCormick means little or nothing to most
of us, yet on his farm, Walnut Grove, near Lexington he made
repeated attempts to invent a workable reaper. His son, Cyrus,
had watched with growing interest each of his father's undertakings.
His regrets must have been as keen as the elder McCormick's
when they realized one May morning in 1831 that the
clumsy machine could not replace the hand scythe and cradle.</p>

<p>Cyrus knew something of machinery and determined to improve
his father's poor invention in time for the next harvesting.
During the intervening six weeks he stayed in the workshop as
much as the busy growing season would allow and secured the
ready help of a slave boy, Joe Anderson.</p>

<p>In July when the wheat was ready to harvest Cyrus and his
father moved the machine out to the field. There a crowd of
neighbors gathered and watched with fascination as the reaper
cut six acres of wheat during the day.</p>

<p>McCormick continued to improve his invention and other
farmers risked their money in purchasing the first six he offered
on the market. Eventually the news spread to the grain fields of
the Middle West and he opened factories to supply the farmers
there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>For years the inventor strove to improve the reaper; he discovered
that other labor saving devices were needed equally as
badly, and he offered other types of farm machinery to the rich
farm lands.</p>

<p>Inventive genius lay near Lexington along other lines, too. It
was near here that James Gibbs invented his common sense stitch
sewing-machine which was a forerunner of our more modern
models. And what a labor-saving machine that was to all the
housewives!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Washington College</span></h3>

<p>The Scotch-Irish were determined to have the best schools and
colleges for their children. The Hanover Presbytery, which in
1776 embraced all the Presbyterian churches in Virginia, established
a school which they called Liberty Hall Academy. This
was built in Lexington, Virginia, with the Reverend William
Graham, a native of Pennsylvania, as its first president. George
Washington, in 1796, gave the school a regular endowment, the
first of its kind. This is how it was made:</p>

<p>The Legislature of Virginia "as a testimony of their gratitude
for his services," and as "a mark of their respect," presented to
George Washington a certain number of shares in the Old James
River Company, an industry then in progress. Unwilling to
accept anything for his own benefit, he gave it to the Liberty
Hall Academy.</p>

<p>In 1812, the Trustees of the school voted to ask the Virginia
Legislature to change the name to Washington College. Many
others decided to follow George Washington's fine example.
A Mr. John Robinson left his whole estate to the college; the next
to aid it, we are told, was the newly organized Society of the
Cincinnati of Virginia.</p>

<p>Old records of the school throw an interesting light regarding
the expenses of a student in those far-off days. The treasurer's
bill for tuition, room rent, deposits and matriculation was $45 per
year. Board was $7.50 a month. Laundry, fuel, candles and bed
amounted to about three dollars per month. The cost of everything
averaged about $140 a year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Lexington" id="Lexington"></a>Lexington</h2>


<p>When he was beset and overwhelmed, and without supplies,
Robert Edward Lee reached Appomattox in April, 1865, and
surrendered to General Grant on April 9th. He realized that the
people of the South needed courage and strength, and though he
was offered many places of honor with splendid salaries, he decided
to help rebuild Virginia. When the call came to become
president of Washington College in Lexington he accepted and
took up his duties there in October, 1865.</p>

<p>As he spoke to the students assembled in the new chapel he
saw familiar faces. Many of them had followed him during
the years of the War Between the States; they, too, had courage
and hope. These boys and men loved the noble man and they
were willing to follow him in rebuilding their homes and the
Southland.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All good citizens must unite in honest efforts to obliterate the
effects of war, and to restore the blessings of peace. They must not
abandon their country, but go to work and build up its prosperity.</p>

<p>"The young men especially must stay at home, bearing themselves
in such a manner as to gain the esteem of every one, at the same time
that they maintain their own respect.</p>

<p>"It should be the object of all to avoid controversy, to allay passion,
and to give scope to every kindly feeling."</p></div>

<p>In every respect he was prepared to be the president of a great
school, for he himself had been a model student at West Point.
He had already served as Superintendent there for three years.</p>

<p>He was very happy during the short years he lived in Lexington.
He had the grounds improved, planted many trees, and
repaired the much worn buildings. He studied and worked over
the courses of study and enlarged the faculty.</p>

<p>A young girl who was visiting in the home of General Lee in
Lexington, tells the following story. It was soon after the Surrender
at Appomattox and his acceptance of the Presidency of
Washington College.</p>

<p>General Lee, with his family, was living in one of the comfortable
and large houses near the college. Their home at
Arlington had been confiscated during the War Between the
States, and they had no furniture except some which neighbors
had lent them.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
One day a letter came to General Lee, telling him good news.
A lady who lived in New York wrote him that her husband had
died, and having no children she had decided to give up housekeeping.
She had been very happy and had loved her home.
Now she wanted the furnishings to belong to someone who would
appreciate and would care for them. She wrote she sympathized
with them in not having their own furniture and that there was no
one to whom she had rather give hers.</p>

<p>General Lee hated the thought of accepting, until he read on,
that if he could not use the furniture himself, perhaps he could
use it in his college. After some time he wrote the lady he
would be very grateful and would appreciate it very much.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mrs. Lee was looking forward to its coming,
for her large rooms were indeed very bare. At last the great
boxes came. General Lee was busy, so Mrs. Lee waited until he
could be present to have them opened.</p>

<p>After lunch one day, General Lee had men come to open
them. Mrs. Lee's eyes shone as the first box revealed two huge
red velvet carpets.</p>

<p>She looked at the General. His eyes were shining too.</p>

<p>"Look, my dear," he said, "The very thing we need! If we
cut them carefully, we will have enough to carpet the platform
and the aisles of the new chapel!"</p>

<p>"Of course," she smiled, never saying one word about how
warm and lovely they would make the double parlors in their
own home.</p>

<p>The next box was opened with intense interest. The men
lifted out the upper part of a handsome bookcase. The next
brought the lower half, a lovely desk, with many drawers.</p>

<p>"Oh," thought Mrs. Lee. "That will fill up that terrible space
between the windows."</p>

<p>"This is the very thing we want," General Lee said, as the men
took them to the walk. "We will put that in the basement of
the new chapel. We will use it for our records and put our
best books in the bookcase, and this will be the beginning of our
college library."</p>

<p>And so it went. He used the best of everything for his college,
and Mrs. Lee took only the odds and ends which did not fit any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>where
else. Someone told her she should have taken a stand and
insisted upon taking some of the best.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she laughed, "it was worth giving all of it up to
see the joy the General had in putting it to use in his college.
The boys come first&mdash;both of us are so interested in them."</p>

<p>General Lee died in October, 1870, loved by men and women,
boys and girls in both the North and South. His body rests under
a beautiful white marble figure, which was sculptured by his
friend, Edward Valentine. It is called the Recumbent Statue of
General Lee and lies in the Chapel of Washington and Lee. This
is now a shrine to which hundreds come daily from all over the
world to pay their homage, love and respect to this great man.</p>

<p class="caption">Virginia Military Institute</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Virginia Military Institute</span></h3>

<p>Virginia Military Institute was first an academy and was
established in connection with Washington College by an act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the Legislature during the years 1838-9. A guard of soldiers had
been maintained at the expense of the State for the purpose of
affording protection to the arms deposited in the Lexington
arsenal for the use of the militia in western Virginia. It was
through the influence of Governor McDowell, who came from
Rockbridge County, that this militia was made into an educational
unit of Washington College.</p>

<p>One seldom thinks of the Virginia Military Institute without
associating with it the noted Colonel Claudius Crozet&mdash;soldier,
educator and engineer. He was the first president of the V.M.I.
Board of Visitors. An imposing hall at the Institute is named in
his honor.</p>

<p>In the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Hall hangs the painting
which depicts the charge of the corps of cadets at the Battle of
New Market. "This great painting, not a mural, is one of the
largest canvas paintings in the country"&mdash;according to authorities
there.</p>

<p>Among other memorial buildings is the one erected in honor of
Brigadier-General Scott Shipp, a former cadet, instructor and
superintendent; Maury-Brooke Hall, dedicated to Matthew Fontaine
Maury, the Pathfinder of the Seas and honoring Commander
John Mercer Brooke, inventor of the deep-sea sounding apparatus
and builder of the first successful iron-clad vessel, the "Merrimac."</p>

<p>During the War Between the States the greater part of the
buildings were destroyed by Federal authority. When General
Lee heard of this tragedy he wrote to General F. H. Smith, the
superintendent there. We quote his letter because of its prophetic
message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&nbsp;<span class="rpos">"<span class="smcap">Camp Petersburg, (Va.)</span> <i>July 4, 1864</i>.</span></p>

<p>"I have grieved over the destruction of the Military Institute. But
the good that has been done to the country cannot be destroyed, nor
can its name or fame perish. It will rise stronger than before, and
continue to diffuse its benefits to a grateful people. Under wise administration,
there will be no suspension of its usefulness. The
difficulties by which it is surrounded will call forth greater energies
from its officers and increased diligence from its pupils. Its prosperity
I consider certain.</p>

<p>"With great regards, yours very truly,</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="rpos">
"<span class="smcap">R. E. Lee.</span>"</span></p>

There is a glamor attached to this Virginia school unique in the
country. It comes not alone from the bright cadet uniforms, the
parade grounds, the gray stone barracks and the <i>esprit de corps</i>
evidenced there; part is kept alive by the hundreds of loyal alumni
and friends whose devotion is unlimited. This "West Point of
the South" maintains the traditions of the time of Stonewall
Jackson and graduates young officers for the army and young
men for every field of business. A current Broadway show of
popular appeal and a cinema of note is that of "Brother Rat"
which depicts the life at V.M.I.</p>

<h2><a name="Culpeper_Minute_Men" id="Culpeper_Minute_Men"></a>Culpeper Minute Men</h2>


<p>Who can resist a story about the Revolutionary War? There
is a fascination surrounding the heroes and heroines of that era
and most of us listen attentively to any legend depicting the
action of our forefathers.</p>

<p>From a point along the Skyline Drive one may look toward
Culpeper County. (In fact, in all probability you passed through
a part of this old county if you took an east to west route to reach
the drive.) Among other things Culpeper is justly famous for its
Minute Men of the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>The town was formed from Orange in 1748 and was named
in honor of Lord Culpeper, Governor of Virginia from 1680 to
1683. This land was a part of the original land grant to Lord
Fairfax. It was here in the old Courthouse that young George
Washington produced his commission as surveyor. The record
reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"20th July, 1749&mdash;George Washington Gent. produced a commission
from the President and Master of William and Mary College,
appointing him to be surveyor of this county, which was read, and
thereupon he took the usual oaths to his majesty's person and government,
and took and subscribed the abjuration oath and test, and then
took the oath of surveyor, according to law."</p></div>

<p>Speaking years later in the Senate, John Randolph of Roanoke
remarked that the Minute Men "were raised in a minute, armed
in a minute, marched in a minute, fought in a minute, and van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>quished
in a minute." These soldiers chose as part of their
uniform green hunting shirts with "Liberty or Death" stamped in
large letters across the front. Buck tails hung from their old hats
and from their belts swung tomahawks and scalping knives.
Their wild appearance on reaching Williamsburg, the capital of
the colony, set the inhabitants in as much fear as did the thought
of invasion by the enemy! Lieutenant John Marshall who was
later to become Chief Justice was among the number&mdash;as was
his father.</p>

<p>The slogan of the Minute Men "Liberty or Death" brought
forth humor from one wag who said the phrasing was too strong
for him; he would enlist if it were changed to "Liberty or Be
Crippled."</p>

<p>Almost upon their immediate arrival at Williamsburg they
were marched to Norfolk County and were participants in the
Battle of Great Bridge.</p>

<h2><a name="Blind_Preacher" id="Blind_Preacher"></a>Blind Preacher</h2>


<p>Not so far from Gordonsville there is a simple marker near the
site of "Belle Grove," a little church made famous by a blind
preacher. And back of the monument itself is a story well worth
repeating. It is a tale told by William Wirt in his <i>British Spy</i>.</p>

<p>In that account Wirt said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was one Sunday as I travelled through the county of Orange,
that my eye was caught by a cluster of horses tied near a ruinous old
wooden house in the forest, not far from the roadside. Having frequently
seen such objects before, in travelling through these States, I
had no difficulty in understanding that this was a place of religion."</p></div>

<p>He stated further that he was filled with curiosity as to the type
of minister who would preach in such a wilderness as he was
passing through and so he stopped and joined the worshippers.
He described the preacher, a Presbyterian in faith, as having one
of the most striking appearances he had ever seen and a most
remarkable delivery.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have never seen, in any other orator, such a union of simplicity
and majesty. He has not a gesture, an attitude, or an accent, to which
he does not seem forced by the sentiment which he is expressing. His
mind is too serious, too earnest, too solicitous, and, at the same time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
too dignified, to stoop to artifice. Although as far removed from
ostentation as a man can be, yet it is clear from the train, the style, and
substance of his thoughts, that he is not only a very polite scholar, but
a man of extensive and profound erudition."</p></div>

<p>James Waddel was the name of this remarkable old man of
God. He was born in Ireland in 1739 and was brought to
America as an infant.</p>

<p>Another interesting tale was told in the neighborhood. Waddel's
fame as a preacher had spread through the vicinity. On one
occasion a committee from a different faith prepared to wait on
him and urge him to occupy their pulpit as well as his own.
Upon nearing his dwelling they were shocked to hear sweet
plaintive notes coming from a violin and resolved to learn who
in his household would dare to play the devil's instrument.
They crept softly to the window. Such amazement was theirs
when they saw their potential minister himself drawing the bow&mdash;and
with apparent enjoyment and satisfaction. More quickly
than they had approached did they leave the yard and felt
righteously thankful that they had seen the true nature of the
man before it was too late!</p>

<p>Not only did the Blind Preacher serve as minister, but like
others of his profession he conducted a school.</p>

<p>And what happened to the old church itself? Long abandoned
as a meeting house for the Presbyterians, about 1850 it was sold
and taken down by the "Sons of Temperance" and converted into
a temperance hall at Gordonsville. Later it housed a school.
Finally it was sold to a colored preacher as a church for his flock.</p>

<h2><a name="Hebron_Church" id="Hebron_Church"></a>Hebron Church</h2>


<p>Outstanding among the old churches in this part of Virginia
is Hebron Church in Madison County.</p>

<p>The little colony of Germans at Germanna, to whom we have
already referred, and a few immigrants from Holland were responsible
for its early establishment. First it was known as "Old
Dutch Church." Located on its original site its existence has
been in three different counties: Orange, Culpeper and now
Madison!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Hebron is the oldest Lutheran church not only in Virginia but
in the South. About 1733 the nucleus of the congregation met
and sent a representative to England for a pastor. It seems a bit
surprising that no English parson felt the call to tend the flock
in an outpost of Virginia, but it is true that no one was possessed
of the missionary spirit to that extent.</p>

<p>In 1735 a Hessian who had come to America eight years before,
the Rev. Casper Stoever, left his home in Pennsylvania and became
the first pastor. His annual salary, by the way, was four
thousand pounds of tobacco or just about forty dollars in currency.
This was paid by the congregation in addition to the taxes which
were required of the Non-Conformist churches towards the upkeep
of the established English church.</p>

<p>Everyone in Madison is vastly proud of the old pipe organ
at Hebron. It was built in 1800 at Philadelphia and brought
to its present place on wagon&mdash;a journey which took a long time
and infinite pains. Jacob and Michael Rouse were entrusted with
the task of hauling. The organ cost two hundred pounds sterling.
Interesting, too, is the complete old communion service which
dates back to the church's early beginnings.</p>

<p>In recent years visiting concert organists have played on the
fine old instrument at the request of the congregation.</p>

<h2><a name="Hoovers_Camp_on_the_Rapidan_River" id="Hoovers_Camp_on_the_Rapidan_River"></a>Hoover's Camp on the Rapidan River</h2>


<p>During the administration of former President Hoover a fine
camp was built on the banks of the Rapidan River in Madison
County where the Chief Executive, his family and friends enjoyed
the trout fishing and rustic life that the camp afforded. A main
lodge was erected for the President. Guest lodges for the Cabinet
members and others were located nearby. This retreat is within
easy driving distance of the White House and was in constant
use for week-ends during the summer months. From Washington
the Presidential parties took route 211 to Warrenton and from
there two routes were offered: either a continuation of route 211
to Sperryville, then south to Criglersville on route 16, or from
Warrenton to Culpeper to Criglersville.</p>

<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Hoover became very much interested in the
life of the mountaineers who grew to be their friendly neighbors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
You have heard the story, no doubt, of the small unlettered boy
who brought a gift to the President and who aroused in him and
Mrs. Hoover the desire to see a school built in the neighborhood
which would serve a large mountain area. An excellent little
frame building nestles among the sloping hills which attracts the
children of all ages within a radius of many miles. One part of
the building is used for class instruction and the rest for living
quarters for the teacher. This school was made possible largely
through the efforts of Mr. and Mrs. Hoover.</p>

<p>One may see the school and the entrance to the Rapidan Camp
by following the road which leads from Big Meadow, a plateau
on the Skyline Drive, to Criglersville.</p>

<p>The camp is still in use at times. Cabinet members and other
government officials enjoy its stream and mountain beauties, but
not to the extent of former times.</p>

<h2><a name="Charlottesville_and_Albemarle_County" id="Charlottesville_and_Albemarle_County"></a>Charlottesville and Albemarle County</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Father of the University of Virginia</span></h3>


<p>Every school child knows the outstanding facts about Thomas
Jefferson. He will rattle off quickly that he was born near
Charlottesville in Albemarle County, in 1743, that he was at
William and Mary College when only seventeen and played his
fiddle which he had carried as he rode the long miles between
Charlottesville and Williamsburg. He graduated there and was
admitted to the bar. Thomas Jefferson drafted, at the request of
the Committee, the Declaration of Independence. He was Governor
of Virginia during the trying years of the Revolutionary
War. We shall not give all the offices which he held, except to
mention that he spent some years abroad in France as United
States Minister. For almost forty years he served his country,
having been President of it from 1801 to 1809.</p>

<p>It is from the quaint letters of his granddaughter, Ellenora
Randolph, that one may read of the tenderness, the lovable
disposition and the human side of this great American.</p>

<p>She was said to be his favorite grandchild and she writes of
how she sat on his knee and played with his huge watch chain.
He never went to Philadelphia without bringing her little luxuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
which it was impossible to buy in Virginia. He brought her a
Bible, a lady's side saddle, a Leghorn hat, and a set of Shakespeare.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">&quot;Monticello&quot;, Near Charlottesville, Va.</p>
</div>

<p>She tells how Jefferson's wife had died when his daughters
were quite young and that he had been so kind and sympathetic
in "shaping their lives."</p>

<p>There is an interesting love story here, too, for Ellenora met and
fell in love with Joseph Coolidge of Boston. He came a-wooing
the Virginia beauty, and according to the custom of that day, he
wrote Mr. Jefferson of his intentions to marry his granddaughter
before he proposed to her.</p>

<p>The following is Jefferson's reply to Joseph Coolidge:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&nbsp;<span class="rpos">"<span class="smcap">Monticello</span>, <i>October 24, 1824</i>.</span></p>

<p>"I avail myself of the first moment of my ability to take up a pen
to assure you that nothing would be more welcome to me than the
visit proposed and its object.... I assure you no union could give
me more satisfaction if your wishes are mutual. Your visit to Monticello
and at the time of your convenience will be truly welcome, and
your stay, whatever may suit yourself. My gratification will be
measured by the time of its continuance....</p>

<p>"I expect in the course of the first or the second week of the
approaching month to receive here the visit of my ancient friend,
General LaFayette. The delirium which his visit has excited in the
North envelopes him in the South also ... and the county of Albemarle
will exhibit its great affection and unending means in a
dinner given the General in the building of the University, to which
they have given accepted invitations to Mr. and Mrs. James Madison
and myself as guests; and at which your presence as my guest would
give high pleasure to us all, and to name, I assure you more cordially
than sincerely your friend;</p>

<p>
&nbsp;<span class="rpos">(Signed) "<span class="smcap">Thomas Jefferson.</span>"</span></p></div>

<p>The wedding accounts give the names of fifty distinguished
Americans who came to pay their respects to Ellenora and her
husband. Every distinguished foreigner came in person; besides
these, there came many of the men who had known and loved
Jefferson during all his years of service. Imagine all the horses
that had to be fed, all the gigs and coaches and all the Negro
servants who had to be quartered. No one is surprised that what
the man had accumulated was fast disappearing with so much
hospitality.</p>

<p>But Ellenora had her troubles upon arriving in Boston. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
presents and other possessions had been sent by boat and it had
sunk! Her letter tells of her great distress at losing the trinkets
associated with her happy girlhood. But most of all, she expressed
her grief upon losing a writing desk which Grandfather Jefferson
had had made for her by his master carpenter, a Negro servant.
This was a very talented carver who had faithfully carried out each
detailed design which his master had given him. Now he was
old and had grown blind and he could no longer make one.
This is Jefferson's letter to his granddaughter&mdash;and explains how
a most historic desk went a-travelling:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It has occurred to me that perhaps I can replace it (desk) not
indeed to you, but to Mr. Coolidge, by a substitute, not claiming the
same value from its decorations but the part it has bourne in our
history, and the event with which it has been associated.... Now
I happen to possess the writing box on which the Declaration of
Independence was written. It was made from a drawing of my own,
by Ben Randall, a cabinetmaker in whose house I took lodging on
my first arrival in Philadelphia, in May, 1776, and I have had it ever
since. It claims no merit of particular beauty. It is plain, neat and
convenient and taking no more room on a writing table than a modern
quarto volume it displays itself sufficient for any writing. Mr.
Coolidge must do me the favor of accepting this. Its imaginary value
will increase with the years. If he lives till my age, he may see it
carried in the procession of our nation's birthday."</p></div>

<p>So this is how the famous desk went to New England and was
finally sent to the State Department in Washington by the
Coolidges in 1876.</p>

<p>When Thomas Jefferson was an old man, he began to carry
out his dream, one which he had had for a long time, to build a
university. All his life he had loved to draw plans and he
carefully made his own blueprints. He drew plans for lovely
Monticello when he was twenty-eight years old. His friends came
from far and near to get him to draw plans for their homes.
Ashlawn, Montpelier and others are monuments to this master
builder. He had his own ideas about educating the young men of
Virginia. He wanted to see them fitted to be fine citizens by
having a good education, for he knew it was through good
citizens that a good government would be realized. But first he
had to educate his friends along this line. Many of them still
thought a tutor in the family was the best way. Many did not
believe in "mass education." For ten long years he worked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
get a bill through the Legislature which called for the establishment
of the University of Virginia. At last, in 1825 the school
was opened. But many years passed before Jefferson could get
the buildings he had dreamed of and had planned. Then when
he was eighty-two, his dream came true.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Today one may see his university, set on a sloping hill. The
buildings are models of architecture and Jefferson himself superintended
the construction of them. It is told that he often watched
the carpenters from Monticello through a telescope. Jefferson
also planned those early courses of study and helped in the
selection of the faculty. The spirit of Jefferson is still felt there
today and each generation of students has been enriched by it and
the noble traditions of the school.</p>

<p>Many famous students have gone there. Edgar Allan Poe wrote
"The Raven" and "Anabel Lee" there. An Arctic explorer from
the University was Elisha Kane. Walter Reed studied medicine
and, as we know, won the fight against yellow fever by his heroic
experiments. Each year, men go out from this great old school
who help to build a greater country&mdash;just as Jefferson dreamed
they would.</p>

<p>After his death on July 4, 1826, someone found a paper on
which he had written these words:</p>

<p class="center">
"Here was buried<br />
Thomas Jefferson<br />
Author of the Declaration of American Independence<br />
of the <a name="corr_10"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: Statue">Statute</ins> of Virginia for religious freedom<br />
and Father of the University of Virginia."<br />
</p>

<p>And today, one finds his tomb halfway up the hill to Monticello
and the words above are cut upon the simple shaft which
marks his grave.</p>

<p>Monticello is open to the public and may be reached by a hard
surface road leading out of Charlottesville. Through careful
research and diligence the Monticello Memorial Association has
brought back to the home much of the fine furnishings which
Jefferson himself had collected. At the present time the second
and third floors of the mansion are being faithfully restored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<h3>
<span class="smcap">Jack Jouett's Ride</span></h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here goes to thee, Jack Jouett!<br /><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lord keep thy memr'y green;<br /><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You made the greatest ride, sir,<br /><br /></span>
<span class="i2">That ever yet was seen."<br /><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So reads the last stanza of an inscription on a tablet erected in
his memory. But who was Jack Jouett and what of his "greatest
ride?"</p>

<p>During the stirring days of the American Revolution Thomas
Jefferson was Governor of Virginia. Hearing that the British
were expected to reach Richmond he recommended that the
capital of the colony be moved to Charlottesville until after
danger from the enemy should pass. This was done and Jefferson
stayed at his home, Monticello.</p>

<p>At Cuckoo Tavern in Louisa County, fifty miles from Charlottesville,
young Jouett was sitting around one night getting the
latest news of the rebellion, when Tarleton, who commanded a
British force, came into the place. Jouett hid from sight and overheard
Tarleton talking with several other English officers. They
said they were impatient to be on their way to Monticello to
capture Jefferson, Patrick Henry and other Virginia leaders. Jack
stayed to hear the route they would take to Charlottesville and
then slipped away on his horse.</p>

<p>The famous ride occurred on back roads in order to beat the
British to their destination. He crossed to the main road long
enough to tell a family of Walkers that the British were coming
for the Governor. Later Tarleton drew in at the same home and
demanded breakfast from Mrs. Walker. Knowing that time
meant a great deal to the rider going ahead with the news, she
delayed the meal as long as possible.</p>

<p>As Jouett climbed the last hill to Monticello he heard the
horses of Tarleton's party in the distance, so he spurred his animal
on and in a last-minute sprint he reached the home. The plans
were revealed and Jefferson hurriedly assembled his family. As
their carriage left by a back road the English came up another and
searched in vain for the Governor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Jouett went from there to Charlottesville to warn the members
of the legislature of the impending danger and they fled to
Staunton&mdash;all but seven of the legislators who were overtaken
and captured. The story is told of how he saved General Stevens,
a member of the Assembly. As they rode along, some British
soldiers saw them and set their horses at a great pace. Jack had
on a plumed hat which might appear important to the soldiers;
he told the general to ride slowly across an open field as if he
were the owner out on an inspection tour of his lands. He himself
would dash off in the hope of getting the troopers to follow
him. The plan worked. Jouett finally left the pursuers far behind
and later on he returned to his home in Charlottesville.</p>

<p>Much later the Virginia legislature passed a resolution commending
the valor of Jack Jouett and presented him with a pair
of pistols and a sword as a mark of appreciation of his service to
the State. Swan Tavern, left him by his father, occupied his time
after the war. He died in Kentucky where he had moved as an
old man.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lewis and Clark Expedition</span></h3>

<p>Thomas Jefferson knew the two young men whom he wanted to
explore the great Northwest, for they had been born almost at the
foot of Monticello. They were Meriwether Lewis and William
Clark. Each of them, almost as boys, had been a soldier and each
loved adventure.</p>

<p>Meriwether Lewis had inherited a fortune from his father and
he could have settled down to a life of ease. But after eighteen
he would not go to school any longer. He had fought in the
Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania and then entered the army.
He was commissioned captain in 1800 and served for three years.
Then Thomas Jefferson asked him to be his secretary and it was
in this office that Jefferson found his admirable qualities.</p>

<p>William Clark was four years older than his friend Lewis.
He was born in 1770 and was a brother of George Rogers Clark.
When he was fourteen years old he went with his family to
the Ohio River where his brother George had built a fort.
There he learned the ways of the Indians and often he was in
the thick of their raids. He, too, joined the regular army and
received his commission when he was only eighteen years old.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
He went to St. Louis and was commissioned as second lieutenant
of the artillery and ordered to join the great expedition.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis was first in <a name="corr_11"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: commond">command</ins> and he selected his men
carefully. There were fourteen soldiers in the little party and
two Canadian boatmen, an interpreter, a hunter and a Negro
servant.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson did not give them a lot of orders. The following
instructions show his wisdom:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Treat them (Indians) in the most friendly and concilliating manner
which their own conduct will admit; allay all jealousies as to the
object of your journey; satisfy them of its innocence; make them acquainted
with the position, extent, character, peaceable, and commercial
intercourse with them; confer with them on the points most convenient
as mutual emporiums and the articles of most desirable interchange for
them and us. If a few of their influential chiefs, within practicable
distance wish to visit us, arrange such a visit with them, and furnish
them with authority to call on our officers on their entering the United
States, to have them conveyed to this place at the public expense. If
any of them should wish to have some of their people brought up
with us and use such arts as may be useful to them, we will receive,
instruct, and take care of them."</p></div>

<p>The fact that so little trouble was had by the party is due to
the skill which Clark used in handling the Indians. We will
not go into the details of the expedition, for everyone knows
what a wonderful, rich territory was gained for the United States
by that expedition.</p>

<h2><a name="Fredericksburg" id="Fredericksburg"></a>Fredericksburg</h2>


<p>Fredericksburg, fifty-five miles south of Washington and about
the same distance north of Richmond, Virginia, on Route 1,
rightly claims to be one of the most historic cities in the United
States. Visitors who make a tour of the Valley of Virginia and
the Skyline Drive may want to begin their trip here, for it
serves as a hub for long or short visits to neighboring places of
interest. From Fredericksburg one may drive to Culpeper, Sperryville
and Panorama and enter the Skyline Drive at that point, or
he may wish to go from Fredericksburg to Warrenton and thence
to the Skyline Drive. Another excellent route is by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Orange and Stanardsville and on to Swift Run Gap, the Southern
entrance to the Drive at the present time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
A splendid trip from this old city is to "Wakefield," the
birthplace of George Washington, in Westmoreland County, and
from there to "Stratford Hall," the ancestral home of the Lee
family and the birthplace of General Lee, both in Westmoreland
County. About two miles from Fredericksburg on this route is
"Ferry Farm" where George Washington spent a part of his
boyhood.</p>

<p>In the city itself there are shrines to famous folks of an earlier
period. The home of Mary Washington, mother of the first
President, is open to the public. "Kenmore," former home of
Betty Washington Lewis and Colonel Fielding Lewis is well cared
for by an association. Both these homes have good examples of
eighteenth century furnishings. The Rising Sun Tavern was the
scene years ago of the Victory Ball after the surrender at Yorktown;
it was host to most of the famous men of Virginia and
neighboring States for years. In the Masonic Lodge are a number
of relics of Washington's time and an original Gilbert Stuart
portrait of the General. General Hugh Mercer, a noted physician
of the <a name="corr_12"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: Reevolution">Revolution</ins> had his apothecary shop in Fredericksburg and
the visitor may see it upon request. Mary Washington's will is
on record at the courthouse here.</p>

<p>On Charles Street in Fredericksburg, Virginia, stands a shrine
to the memory of James Monroe, who served his country in more
public offices than any other American in the history of the United
States. This quaint story-and-a-half brick building, which he
occupied from 1786 to 1788, was the only private law office in
which Monroe practiced his profession. It was built in 1758 and
stands in its original state, even to the woodwork and mantles of
the interior. Only the old brick floor and plastering had to be
restored. This was accomplished in 1928, when the building was
opened to the public as the first shrine to the memory of the fifth
President. At that time there was placed in it the largest number
of Monroe possessions in existence, handed down for five generations
in straight line to his descendants, who made the shrine
possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">James Monroe&#39;s Law Office</p>
</div>

<p>James Monroe brought his bride, the former Elizabeth Kortright
of New York, to Fredericksburg, and in the little shrine are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>hallowed intimate possessions of hers as well as those of her
distinguished husband; a wedding slipper, a dainty French fan;
two handsome court gowns, one of silver brocaded on white satin,
the other of cream colored taffeta, richly embroidered with dahlias
in natural colors; her bonnet and veil in which she welcomed
Lafayette on his return to the States in 1824; her lorgnette, which
must have added to the reputation she had for dignity; her Astor
piano and her silver service marked "J. M."</p>

<p>Of Monroe's personal possessions there are many. Here too is
his court dress with its rare old lace, cut-steel buttons and knee
breeches, worn at Napoleon's court; the quaint huge umbrella
presented him by the City of Boston on the occasion of Lafayette's
return, with its original covering, whale-bone ribs and ivory handle,
all contributing to its weight of seven and one-half pounds; his
mahogany brass-bound dispatch box in which his Louisiana Purchase
papers were carried; his silver-mounted duelling pistols,
recalling that Monroe came near fighting a duel with Alexander
Hamilton; and other articles too numerous to mention, including
interesting historical letters by and to James Monroe from the
outstanding men of his day.</p>

<p>Perhaps the outstanding exhibit in the Law Office shrine, however,
is the desk on which Monroe signed the message to Congress
which formed the basis for the famous Monroe Doctrine.
Mahogany, high, brass-bound, this handsome desk forms a part of
the furniture bought by the Monroes in France, brought by them
to this country in 1798, and now finally shown in the little
museum dedicated to their memory. The Monroes, being the first
to move into the rebuilt White House after the original one had
been burned by the British in the War of 1812, and being confronted
with empty rooms, took with them this lovely furniture.
Still later, on leaving the White House, the beloved possessions
again went with them, and it is to this fact that the happy privilege
of the public to see these things today can be attributed.</p>

<p>More than a hundred years later, a successor of Mrs. Monroe
was to express her patriotism and interest in historical accuracy
through cataloguing and making inventories of the furnishings of
the White House. This lady, Mrs. Herbert Hoover, in searching
the records, learned of the Monroe furniture and of its ultimate
resting place in the Monroe shrine, and asked permission to copy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
it at Government expense, the copies to be placed in the White
House. Permission was gladly given and today there is a "Monroe
Room" in the White House, furnished with the reproductions
of this historic furniture. The originals, however, remain in the
little museum in Fredericksburg, relics of active, public years
spent by a great statesman on two continents.</p>

<p>The Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park
was established in 1927. Quoting from a booklet which may be
secured from the park headquarters we find:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This park was established ... to commemorate six major battles
fought during the great sectional conflict between 1861 and 1865&mdash;the
two Battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Salem Church, Wilderness,
and Spotsylvania Court House&mdash;and to preserve for historical
purposes the remains of earthworks, roads, and other sites of importance
on these battlefields...."</p></div>

<p>At the Battle of Chancellorsville General Stonewall Jackson,
famous Confederate commander, was mortally wounded. A simple

<h2><a name="Kenmore_1752" id="Kenmore_1752"></a>Kenmore&mdash;1752</h2>


<p>Kenmore, the home of Fielding Lewis and Betty Washington
Lewis (George Washington's only sister), is an outstanding
example of the architecture of Colonial Virginia. It is also intimately
connected with the stirring history of Colonial times and
with the life of George Washington.</p>

<p>Augustine Washington, about 1739, moved from Hunting
Creek to Ferry Farm, across the river from Fredericksburg, with
his second wife, Mary Ball, and their five children&mdash;George,
Betty, Samuel, John Augustine, and Charles&mdash;for the sake of
community life and the religious and educational advantages it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
offered. Here the children grew up and received their education&mdash;Betty
at a "Dame School," George under the tutelage of Parson
Marye. Betty and George were especially intimate companions
because of their nearness of age and their similarity in personality
and character.</p>

<p>When Betty was sixteen, and a "mannerly young maid," her
cousin Fielding Lewis came seeking her hand in marriage. Lewis
had come up from Gloucester three years previously with his wife
and son. Mrs. Lewis died in 1749. Shortly thereafter, Fielding
started courting young Betty. They were married in 1750, the
bride being given away by her brother George, and for a time they
lived on a plantation adjoining Ferry Farm. In 1752 Lewis
bought 861 acres of land, adjacent to Fredericksburg, the survey
being made by George Washington, who had been appointed
government surveyor in 1748. On this land, with its fine view
of the countryside, Lewis built Kenmore (called Millbrook
at the time) in accordance with a promise he had made to
his bride.</p>

<p>As time went on, Fielding Lewis became closely associated with
the political life of Virginia. He was a member of the House of
Burgesses for many years. He also served in the French and
Indian War and was Colonel of the <a name="corr_13"></a><ins class="mycorr" title="Original: Spottsylvania">Spotsylvania</ins> County Militia.
It is said that the resolution endorsing Patrick Henry in his
resistance to the tyranny of Governor Dunmore, passed by the
Committee of 600 in the Rising Sun Tavern in Fredericksburg,
was written by him in the Great Room of his home, Kenmore, a
paper which for all intents and purposes was a declaration of
independence.</p>

<p>Colonel Lewis was best known for the part he played in the War
of Independence. In 1776 he became Chairman of the Virginia
Committee of Safety. Previously, in 1775, the Virginia Assembly
had passed an ordinance providing for a "Manufactory of Small
Arms in Fredericksburg, Virginia." Five commissioners were appointed
to undertake this project, but Colonel Lewis and Charles
Dick were the only two who took an active part in the work.
They were allotted £2,500 with which to secure land, buildings
and equipment. Soon thereafter they were at work manufacturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
arms. The first £2,500 were quickly spent, and Lewis and Dick
were obliged to draw from their own funds to carry on. Lewis
advanced an additional £7,000 and borrowed £30,000 to £40,000
more. Lewis also built a ship for the Virginia Navy, <i>The Dragon</i>,
and equipped three regiments. Kenmore was heavily mortgaged
to meet the costs of all these patriotic enterprises. When Lewis
died in 1781, little of the estate was left.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Betty Lewis tried conducting a small boarding
school at Kenmore, but again money had to be raised and piece
after piece of the land was sold to obtain it. Finally, in 1796,
the mansion and its contents were sold and Betty Lewis went to
live with her daughter. She died the next year.</p>

<p>After many vicissitudes in the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, Kenmore was saved for posterity, in 1922, through the
great enthusiasm and hard work of a group of women who later
formed the Kenmore Association. Through the efforts of this
association, the exterior and the interiors of Kenmore were expertly
restored to their original charming appearance and it has been
furnished with original pieces of the period, many of which have
an actual connection with the family.</p>

<p>Who the architect of Kenmore was, is unknown. It is very
probable that Fielding Lewis himself had much to do with the
planning of it, making use of books on English architecture.
The mansion is typical of the formal architecture of Tidewater
Virginia in the mid-eighteenth century. Flanked on each side by
smaller service buildings, both of which are identical in size and
appearance, the group is symmetrical around the central entrance.
The exteriors present a picture of fine restraint and dignity. Four
uniformly placed chimneys in the end walls serve eight fireplaces.
The windows are well proportioned in relation to the main walls.
The walls, of brick laid in Flemish bond, or brickwork pattern,
are two feet thick&mdash;unusually heavy construction for a house of
even this size.</p>

<p>The principal rooms, of stately proportions, are remarkable for
their design and ornament. The richly modelled ceilings, cornices,
and overmantels are outstanding examples of ornamental plater-work&mdash;quite
unsurpassed by anything of its kind in America. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
has always been said and never contradicted that these ornamental
features were planned by George Washington himself.</p>

<p>To the right, as one enters the Reception Hall, tinted in pastel
blue-gray, is the well designed main stairway, a noteworthy feature
of which is the delicately carved lotus leaf ornament. In back is
the prized grandfather clock which originally belonged to Mary
Washington.</p>

<p>Passing through the arched doorway at the rear of the Hall, one
enters the Great Room. For the magnificent ceiling of this room,
Colonel Lewis employed the same French decorator whom Washington
had employed for the ornamental ceilings at Mount
Vernon. The design motif includes four horns of plenty. Tradition
has it that the overmantel in the Great Room was done at a
later time than the other decorations by two Hessian soldiers
captured at the Battle of Trenton. The design, an adaptation of
Æsop's fable of the fox, the crow, and the piece of cheese, is
supposed to have been suggested by George Washington at the
request of his sister; this particular fable being chosen to teach his
nephews to beware of flattery. The rich red of the brocade
draperies contrasts with the light green of the walls and the white
of the ceiling and mantel. A crystal chandelier of old Waterford
glass forms a sparkling accent in the middle of the room. The
floor is covered almost entirely with an early eighteenth century
Oushak rug. The furniture in this room as well as elsewhere
generally is American of Chippendale design. Of particular note
are two portraits of Fielding, and two of Betty Lewis&mdash;all four
by Wollaston.</p>

<p>The ceiling of the Library has the four seasons for its decorative
motif and the overmantel is a design of fruits and flowers. The
walls, like those of the Great Room, are tinted a soft green.</p>

<p>"The Swan and Crown" of the Washington crest is carved in
the woodwork under the mantel in the Dining Room. The walls
are a deep blue-green, the woodwork a lighter matching shade.
Draperies are a soft green brocade. The service building on the
Dining Room side of the House contains the kitchen.</p>

<p>On the second floor are the master bedrooms and guest room
where General Lafayette and many another distinguished visitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
stayed. These eighteenth century rooms, so well treated and furnished,
serve as timeless models of good taste in bedrooms.</p>

<p>Next to Mount Vernon, George Washington was most interested
in Kenmore. He had taken a keen interest from the beginning
in the building of the House and the landscaping of the
grounds. After the War he set out thirteen chestnut trees near
the House, one for each of the original thirteen States. One of
these still lives. Mary Washington, mother of George and Betty,
lived in the cottage on the estate, not far from the Main House; a
home her son had provided for her at the beginning of the War.</p>

<p>The restoration of the grounds was undertaken by the Garden
Club of Virginia in 1929 with funds obtained from the public
participation in the first "Virginia Garden Week." One feature
of this work is the brick wall around the premises, built in 1930.
The sunken turf driveway is the original driveway that used to
surround a grassy circle. Handsome box bushes, ancient and
familiar features of Virginia estates, flank the approaches to the
House now as of old. The gardens, too, contain flowers that Betty
Washington must have enjoyed&mdash;bushes of lilac, mock orange,
and bridal wreath and beds of pansies, sweet william, phlox,
verbena and lilies of the valley.</p>

<p>Kenmore, a background of those lives who helped so importantly
to mould the destinies of our nation, vividly portrays the art
and the culture of its time.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Mary_Washington_House" id="The_Mary_Washington_House"></a>The Mary Washington House</h2>


<p>There stands on the corner of Charles and Lewis Streets in
Fredericksburg, Virginia, an unpretentious but charming little
house. There is no spot in America more sacred. It was the
home of Mary Ball Washington, wife of Augustine Washington,
and the mother of George Washington.</p>

<p>It is recorded that on Dec. 8, 1761 lots 107 and 108 upon
which the Mary Washington House stands were sold by Fielding
Lewis and Betty, his wife, with all houses, trees, woods, under-woods,
profits commodities, hereditaments and appurtenances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
whatsoever, to Michael Robinson for £250 and bought by George
Washington Sept. 18, 1772 for £275.</p>

<p>After remodeling and adding to the house, George Washington
moved his mother from the Ferry Farm, which had been her home
since 1739, to Fredericksburg and it was here that she spent her
last days.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;The Mary Washington House&quot;, Fredericksburg, Virginia</p>
</div>

<p>It was here that she received the courier sent by General
Washington to tell her of the victory at Trenton. It was here that
Washington came after the Battle of Yorktown with the French
and American officers and she received him with thanksgiving
after an absence of nearly seven years. It was here he came in
December, 1783, when Fredericksburg gave the Peace Ball in his
honor, and it was at that time that he made his memorable reply
to Mayor McWilliams in which he spoke of Fredericksburg as
"the place of my growing infancy."</p>

<p>It was here that the Marquis de LaFayette came to pay his
respects to her, who was the mother of the greatest American.
She received him in her garden, met all his fine phrases with
dignity and gave him her blessing when he bade her goodbye.</p>

<p>It was here, March 12, 1789, that Washington came to receive
his mother's blessing before he went on to New York to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
inauguration. This was his last farewell to his mother. She did
not not live to see him again. It was here she died Aug. 25, 1789.
Town and country assembled to do honor at her burial. Her
remains lie near the "Meditation Rock" where she requested to
be buried and a stately monument "erected by her country-women"
marks her last resting place.</p>

<p>Except for a portion of the house at Epping Forest, where she
was born, the Mary Washington House in Fredericksburg is the
only house now standing in which Mary Washington lived.</p>

<p>It passed into various hands and finally in 1890 it was about to
be sold to the Chicago Exposition but through Mrs. Robert C.
Beale and Mrs. Spotswood W. Carmichael, the Association for
the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities was appealed to. Mrs.
Joseph Bryan of blessed memory was at that time President and
from her own means advanced the money to purchase it, $4,500,
and the place was saved.</p>

<p>In 1929, through the generosity of Mr. George A. Ball of
Muncie, Ind., the first work of restoration on the house was done.
Mr. Ball also purchased for the A. P. V. A. the adjoining house
and garden for a home for the custodian.</p>

<p>In 1930 the house was redecorated and refurnished by Mr. and
Mrs. Francis P. Garvan. The original colors have been restored
and contemporary fabrics used for all draperies and coverings.</p>

<p>The furnishings, with the exception of a few pieces that belonged
to Mary Washington, are authentic antiques loaned from
the Mabel Brady Garvan Institute of American Arts and Crafts at
Yale University. The original mantels and paneling are interesting.</p>

<p>The old English-type garden is especially beautiful. The boxwood
she planted still grows there, as well as the flowers of her
time. The original sun-dial still marks the sunny hours.</p>

<h2><a name="Rising_Sun_Tavern" id="Rising_Sun_Tavern"></a>Rising Sun Tavern</h2>


<p>Was built about 1760 by Charles Washington, a brother of
George Washington. It was first known as the Washington
Tavern and later as the Eagle Tavern. The following advertise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>ment
appeared in the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>, published in Williamsburg
in 1776:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&nbsp;<span class="rpos">"<span class="smcap">Falmouth</span>, <i>March 25, 1776</i>.</span></p>

<p>"William Smith takes this method to acquaint his friends, and the
publick in general, that he intends to open tavern, on Monday the
22nd day of April next, in the house lately occupied by Colonel
George Weedon, in the town of Fredericksburg. He has laid in a
good stock of liquors, and will use his utmost endeavors to give general
satisfaction. N.B. 'A good cook wench wanted, on hire'."</p></div>

<p class="caption">&quot;Rising Sun Tavern&quot;, Fredericksburg, Virginia</p>
</div>

<p>It was the favorite meeting place of such patriots as Thomas
Jefferson, Patrick Henry, James Monroe, George Washington,
General Hugh Mercer, George Mason, John Marshall, the Lees,
and other noted men, who gathered here to protest against unjust
treatment by the mother country and to discuss the proper steps to
rid the country of tyranny. It was said to be a hot-bed of sedition
and that here much of the head work of the Revolution was done.</p>

<p>When the news came to Fredericksburg that the governor, Lord
Dunmore, had secretly removed twenty barrels of gunpowder
from the public magazine in Williamsburg, also the news of the
battle of Lexington, there was great excitement and indignation.
Immediately six hundred armed men from the town and surrounding
country, at the call of Patrick Henry, assembled in Fredericks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>burg
and offered their services to defend their country. More than
one hundred men were dispatched to Richmond and Williamsburg
to ascertain the condition of affairs. They were advised there by
Washington, Peyton Randolph, Edmund Pendleton and other
leaders to disband and delay action at least for a while or until
general plans of resistance could be decided upon. Returning to
Fredericksburg they called a meeting and reluctantly agreed to
disperse, but before doing so adopted resolutions bitterly denouncing
Dunmore's action, and without fear or evasion declared that
the troops would preserve their liberty at the hazard of their lives
and fortune. They pledged themselves to re-assemble at a moment's
warning and by force of arms defend the laws and rights
of this or any other sister colony from unjust invasion, and concluded
with the significant words, "God save the liberties of
America."</p>

<p>This was on April 29, 1775, twenty-one days prior to the
celebrated Mecklenburg declaration and more than one year before
the great Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.</p>

<p>It has always been said that this meeting was held at the Rising
Sun Tavern. (Reference: Quinn's <i>History of Fredericksburg</i>,
Howison's <i>History of Virginia</i>, Forces' <i>Archives</i>, quoted in <i>William
and Mary Quarterly</i> in October, 1909.)</p>

<p>But in addition to giving their attention to the serious questions
of the day, could we but raise the curtain of Time we no doubt
would witness a gay scene typical of colonial days with courtly
gentlemen in powdered wigs, knee breeches, ruffled blouses, and
silver-buckled slippers, or perhaps in the rougher garb of the
pioneer traveler playing cards and partaking of the various drinks
served by a venerable old slave and his young negro assistants.
It is recorded that George Washington played cards here and
"lost as usual," and that he was afraid those Fredericksburg
fellows were "too smart for him."</p>

<p>Here General Weedon kept the post office. This was a distributing
point for mails coming in from the far north and south
on horse-back or stage-coach. Picture the eager crowd awaiting
the arrival of the slow courier.</p>

<p>LaFayette and his staff of French and American officers visited
the Rising Sun Tavern Nov. 11, 1781, en route from Yorktown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
to Philadelphia. In December, 1824, LaFayette again visited
Fredericksburg, and was given a ball at the Rising Sun Tavern.</p>

<p>In 1907 the Association for the Preservation of Virginia
Antiquities bought the property from Judge A. W. Wallace,
whose family had owned it since 1792. It was in a very bad state
of dilapidation, and only the loving interest and hard work of a
few patriotic ladies made possible the necessary repairs and saved
to posterity this historic old building with its wealth of associations
with the people and events which shaped our nation.</p>

<p>The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities
has recently completed extensive repairs and the visitor will find
it one of the most interesting places in the city to visit. It is
attractively furnished with antique pieces of the Colonial period,
many having great historic value.</p>

<p>One may see a desk owned and used by Thomas Jefferson, a
chair which belonged to James Monroe, a rare copy of an autographed
letter from Mary Washington to her son George Washington,
brass andirons, pewter-hooded candles, Betty lamp, immense
iron key for a wine cellar, brass candle-sticks, iron candle
snuffers, pewter ink-well, antique piano, high boy, needle-point
sampler worked by a nine-year-old child, spinning wheel and reel,
stage coach sign dated 1775, large early American desk, old iron
cooking utensils used by slaves cooking by an open fireplace, and
many other interesting things.</p>

<h2><a name="Roanoke" id="Roanoke"></a>Roanoke</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Gateway To the Great Southwestern Empire</span></h3>


<p>Raw-re-noke is an Indian word for money. The city of Roanoke
was originally a land grant to Thomas Tosh, an old settler who
came to "Big Lick" and settled there after King George II and
King George III had granted him sixteen hundred acres of land
along that fertile valley. "Big Lick" was a favorite spot for the
wild game and for the Indians too, for there they found the salt
so necessary to life itself. One of Tosh's daughters married
General Andrew Lewis and became the mother of Major Andrew
Lewis and Thomas Lewis.</p>

<p>Later on, as more settlers came into the valley, quite a village
grew up around "Big Lick" and in 1874 it was incorporated with
John Trout as Mayor. Then in 1881 the village woke up. Saws
and hammers were heard from dawn 'til dusk. The Roanoke
Machine Works were being built. Nearby, stores and houses were
springing up, warehouses and boarding-houses. Surveyors were
laying off lots and laying out streets. Contractors and engineers,
artisans and mechanics were coming in every day. The men who
sold supplies for all of these were indeed busy. The Norfolk
and Western Railroad had come to Roanoke!</p>

<p>Old folks can still remember when rabbits ran over the grounds
where stands the Hotel Roanoke. Small boys picked up Indian
arrow-heads where now the beautiful grounds sweep down to the
Station itself. They still tell how Salem Avenue was once a
marsh and was later filled in for the fast growing town. Then
came the union of the Norfolk and Western and the Shenandoah
Valley Railroads. From that day to this, Roanoke has been the
"Magic City." It was as if some magic wand had been waved
over the one-time little village. But actually it was due to the
industry and vision of the city planners who had built for the
future. Commercial, manufacturing and industrial activities kept
a pace ahead of the fast growing town. Among the first of these
were the American Bridge Works and the rolling mills, iron
works, West End Furnaces and the Virginia Brewing Company.</p>

<p>Long ago "Big Lick" was known to a few. It was situated
in the Blue Ridge Mountains, surrounded by rolling valleys and
watered by springs of crystal clear waters. Other streams made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
it an ideal place for the herds of buffalo and elk which roamed
up and down the Valley of the Great Spirit. Indians came, too,
to hunt them and thousands of smaller fur-bearing animals and
birds for their feasts.</p>

<p>When the sturdy settlers from Ireland and Scotland came to
seek a new home in the wilderness, they chose to follow the
Great Road which later was known as the Wilderness Road. This
led them along the beautiful valleys and across the mountains;
soon tiny cabins, churches and crude taverns were being built.</p>

<p>Near where Fincastle stands today, there came a man years ago
from Ireland, Thomas King. He had left behind his second wife,
Easter, three children by his first wife, and several younger ones
by Easter. He had come to make a home for them in Fincastle
County and ran a tavern near where Roanoke stands today.</p>

<p>Then Easter wrote him that his oldest son, William, had arrived
in Philadelphia and was working for a merchant. He was peddling
merchandise and liked the new country.</p>

<p>Thomas was delighted and eager to see his fourteen-year-old
son. He saddled his own horse and led a pony all the miles
down the long Valley trail. He passed such settlements as Staunton,
Lexington, Winchester, Hagerstown, camping out or, stopping
at some settler's house over-night. It took weeks for him
to make the long trip.</p>

<p>The merchant in the meantime realized he had a smart salesman
in William and he made a bargain with him a few days
before his father arrived. He asked him not to work for anyone
else and set a time limit for his employment with him.</p>

<p>We can imagine how William felt when his father came,
bringing a pony for him to ride back to Virginia. But he kept his
word. He continued to go out with his peddler's pack on his
back and his bright smile and polite manners helped him to sell
his wares long before others sold theirs. The merchant told
him he could go peddling to Virginia and that he could leave
some of his articles in his father's tavern. William did this,
leaving them at other taverns along the Great Road, too. And
thus began the early chain stores.</p>

<p>When the pioneers began going on farther down the Southwestern
part of Virginia, Thomas King went as far as where
Abingdon stands today. He sent William back to Ireland for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
step-mother and his brothers and sisters. William now had a
little money and he inherited some from his grandmother, so he
not only brought his family over, but he paid for several other
Scotch-Irish and charged a little extra as interest until they could
repay him.</p>

<p>He liked the people and the lovely country around Abingdon
and bought land and built himself a home there. He went to
see the salt marsh a few miles away where Saltville is now.
This land was owned by General Russell. William urged him
to develop the marsh, for at one time Indians had come there to
get salt to preserve their game. But General Russell did not think
much of the plan, and agreed to sell it to William.</p>

<p>The story of how he laughed, along with others, at William
King when he dug and dug and did not find the salt spring is
often told. But when William's men had dug for one hundred
and ninety feet the "bottom dropped out" and the salt water
gushed forth. William made thirty thousand dollars a year out of
his salt business and left a fortune to his many nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>Roanoke is the gateway through which the visitor continues
down the famous Valley Pike, Route Eleven. From every curve
in the road one sees the beauty of nature. One learns bits of
early history from the numerous historic signs along the route&mdash;for
every footstep of the brave pioneers was bitterly contested
from here on.</p>

<p>These first settlers were "a remarkable race of people for
intelligence, enterprise and hardy adventure." They had come
partly from Botetourt, Augusta and Frederick counties and from
Maryland and Pennsylvania. They wanted liberty and freedom to
worship God as a man's conscience dictated. They were a strong,
stern people, simple in their habits of life, God-fearing in their
practices, freedom-loving and good neighbors, yet unmerciful in
their dealing with their enemies. Who were the trail blazers for
these Scotch-Irish and Germans?</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas Walker qualified as a surveyor of Augusta County
in 1748. He later set off with Colonel James Wood, Colonel
James Patton, Colonel John Buchanan, and Major Charles Campbell,
some hunters and John Finlay to explore southwest Virginia.</p>

<p>They were followed as far as New River by Thomas Ingles
(or Engles) and his three sons, a Mrs. Draper and her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
George and her daughter Mary, Adam Harman, Henry Leonard
and James Burke. They were pioneers in search of new homes
in the wilderness. Lands were surveyed for all of them on
Wood's River and they made the first settlement west of the
Alleghany Divide.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Drapers_Meadow" id="Drapers_Meadow"></a>Draper's Meadow</h2>


<p>In 1748 Thomas Ingles and his three sons, Mrs. Draper, her
children and James Burke moved westward to find a new home
for themselves beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains. They chose
a lovely spot on a high level plateau in what is now Montgomery
County. They called their new home, "Draper's Meadow," and
soon their new log cabins were built and their first crops were
planted and such a harvest as they reaped that first year! Other
neighbors and relatives from their old homes came to join them
and for some time all went well in the little settlement. James
Burke had been restless and had pushed on down into the southwest
and settled in a valley enclosed for almost ten miles by the
huge Clinch Mountain. This he called "Burke's Garden" and in
telling others about it the old settler said "I have indeed found
the Garden of Eden."</p>

<p>The Indians were very friendly and passed and repassed the
settlement without molesting them.</p>

<p>Then came the trouble with the French which has been referred
to before. The Indians swooped down upon Draper's Meadow
without warning and killed or wounded most of the settlers.
Those whom they did not murder, they carried off into captivity.
Among the latter were Mrs. William Ingles (née Mary Draper)
some of her children and another woman. They were forced to
march for days at a time until they finally reached the Indian
towns on the Ohio River. During the trying days, Mrs. Draper
did her best to keep in the good graces of the Indians. She tried
to help them, even after they took her sons from her. When they
reached Big Bone Lick she helped to make salt for the Indians
and made shirts for them from cloth which had been bought from
the French traders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>She often thought of her home over seven hundred miles from
the Indian towns and determined to make her escape. She confided
her resolves to the other woman who at first objected to
going. At last she convinced her the time was at hand, if ever,
for them to leave. She left her infant son one night, and with
her friend, stole away from the camp. They lived for days on
berries and nuts. They finally killed small game and after many
adventures reached the home of a settler forty long days later.</p>

<p>Mrs. Draper's friend lost her mind, tried to kill her and then
left her. Mrs. Draper reached the homestead of Adam Harmon
on New River. There he heard her crying in his cornfield and
went out to see who it was in such distress. He and his family
cared for her and made her rest before she was taken back to
her family.</p>

<p>The Ingles families moved up higher on New River and built
another fort near the present city of Radford, Virginia. This was
at Ingle's Ferry.</p>

<p>Botetourt County was cut from Albemarle in 1770, and William
Preston was made surveyor of the lands. This was a well-paying
position. He had fallen in love with Miss Susannah Smith
who lived in Eastern Virginia in Hanover County. He built a
house for her and called it Smithfield in her honor. Soon the
Pattons, Peytons, Prestons, the Thompsons and many others were
coming to build homes near them.</p>

<p>When the Prestons moved to Smithfield they took a young
orphan boy with them, Joseph Cloyd. His father had died when
he was very little and his mother had been killed by the Indians.
He grew up with the other pioneer boys and girls and later settled
on Back Creek. This home is near where Pulaski stands today and
thus began another settlement. He was the father of General
Gordon Cloyd and they founded a long line of honorable citizens
in our country.</p>

<p>As one goes on he hears many strange tales of other explorers
and settlers. For instance there is the sad story of Colonel John
Chiswell who found rich lead mines near New River in what is
now Wythe County. For some unknown reason, he had killed
a man in a personal encounter and was put in jail to await trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
In the meantime, the Virginia Council decided to develop the
mines and a fort was ordered to be built. Before the trial came
off and before the fort was built, Colonel Chiswell died.</p>

<p>Colonel William Boyd was made supervisor of the building of
the fort and he named it for his friend, Colonel Chiswell. Soon
settlers began building homes around it, for the climate and rich
grazing lands made it an ideal spot for homesteads.</p>

<p>The settlers pushing southwest from Roanoke built a fort and
named it for a Mr. Vass. The Indians attacked them and several
were killed. This was near where Christiansburg is now located.
It was near Vass's Fort that General Washington, Major Andrew
Lewis and Captain William Preston had a narrow escape from an
attack by the Indians.</p>

<p>In 1754 only six families were living in the early settlement
west of New River. Two of these were in Pulaski, two on
Cripple Creek in Wythe County, one in Smyth County and the
Burke family in what is now Tazewell County. The Indians gave
the settlers so much trouble that any further attempts to settle was
given up until after the French and Indian War.</p>

<p>A small fort, called Black's Fort, was built when the settlers
moved into the Valley around where Abingdon stands. Like most
of its kind, it was built of logs, and a few log cabins were built
within the stockade. Here to these cabins within the fort came
the settlers whenever the warning reached them that the Indians
were coming.</p>

<p>Near the fort lived Parson Cummings, called the Fighting
Parson. He was an Irishman who had come to the Valley from
Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He fought against the Cherokee Indians
in 1776 with Colonel Christian. He first settled in Fincastle, but
soon drifted farther south. It was he who drafted the Fincastle
Resolutions on January 20, 1775 and served on the Committee of
Safety for Washington County.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when the settlers were residing within the
fort, food became very scarce. Someone had to go back into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
clearing and bring in supplies. Parson Cummings and a few
other men started off with a wagon to get them. They had not
gone far when they reached Piper's Hill. A party of Indians
surprised the little band and one of them was killed. Everyone
made a dash for the bushes. The Parson was very stout and he
was wearing a large powdered wig which was considered in those
days necessary to the cloth. This made him more conspicuous and
of course a target for the Indians.</p>

<p>One Indian ran after him, brandishing his tomahawk. The
Parson dodged under a bush and as he left it, his wig was caught
by a low hanging limb. The Indian took for granted that it was
the Parson's head and made a bound to get it. When he took it
in his hands, he was surprised to find no head there! He was
disgusted and angry and threw it upon the ground exclaiming,
"D&mdash;d lie," and doggedly gave up the chase. And thus the
Parson escaped. The man who was killed was later buried in
Abingdon and one may read his name, "William Creswell, July 4,
1776" on the crude stone which marks his grave.</p>

<p>Dragon Canone was the name of the Cherokee Indian who led
his warriors against the white militia. Both white and red men
fought with tomahawks and both hid behind trees. Sometimes
this brave militia went forth to battle without any higher commanding
officer than captain. Three such officers were John
Campbell, James Shelby and James Thompson.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment at what those settlers were denied.
They did not have flour or salt until an order was made:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Jan. 29, 1777. Ordered that William Campbell, William Edmundson,
John Anderson and George Blackburn be appointed commissioners
to hire wagons to bring up the county salt, allotted by the Governor
and council, and to receive and distribute the same agreeably to said
order of the council."</p></div>

<p>Later on Colonel Arthur Campbell rode with seven hundred
mounted soldiers against the Cherokees. History gives him the
credit of being the first to experiment in attacking Indians on
horseback. He destroyed fourteen of their towns and burnt fifty
thousand bushels of their corn after giving his men enough for
their own horses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>The pathetic legend is told of the pioneer woman in Tazewell
County who was carried off by the Indians and was massacred
some distance from home. Her small child was left to die of
exposure and starvation in the mountain wilds and was at last
rescued by a hunting party. The child was pulling at the mother's
body, trying to rouse her and was muttering, "Hungry, mother&mdash;hungry,
mother" when he was found.</p>

<p>That is the origin of the name of the mountain which is not
far from Marion, and the peak of the mountain is called "Molly's
Knob" in memory of the pioneer mother.</p>

<p>The State has created a beautiful park on Hungry Mother
Mountain. Cabins have been erected to house the visitors, a
stream has been dammed up to provide a lake&mdash;and most astonishing
of all to the mountain folk who enjoy their park is the sandy
beach. The sand was hauled 375 miles from Virginia Beach to
its present location.</p>

<p>Swimming, sailing and canoeing are popular water sports;
saddle horses are available and hiking is a favorite occupation.
Ample picnic grounds have been provided. Crowds from nearby
towns enjoy a day at the Park and the cabins are in great demand
from the vacationists in Virginia and surrounding States.</p>

<h2><a name="White_Top" id="White_Top"></a>White Top</h2>


<p>Iron Mountain has lost that name and today is known far and
near as White Top. The visitor looks down five thousand feet
below and can see into Tennessee, West Virginia, North Carolina
and Kentucky. The top is bald, rocky and about three
hundred of its sloping acres are covered with a fine white grass.
In summer one sees hundreds of wild flowers, sturdy evergreens,
similar to Norway spruce, called Lashhorns, berries and many
small animals.</p>

Wilbur Waters, the hermit, is one of the most colorful characters
in the great Southwest and many adventures he had with wild
animals. Wilbur's mother was an Indian who died when he was
very small. His father, who lived in North Carolina at the time,
apprenticed the boy to a shoemaker to learn that trade. The little
boy, no doubt homesick, could not stand his new home. He ran
away and from that time on made his own living. When he heard
how the wolves were making havoc for the settlers in and around
Abingdon, he came to get the rewards offered for their heads. He
built himself a rude shack on White Top, and if one would read
real adventure tales, let him read <i>Wilbur Waters</i> which relates
many stirring ones.</p>

<p>Every summer during August a festival is held at White Top
where mountain music is played and folk dances are held. John
Powell, the noted Virginia composer, is especially active in the
preservation of folk music and he has been instrumental in
attracting people of influence to the celebration.</p>

<p>The major highways lead to within a comparatively short
distance of White Top and the State Highway Department
assures the traveler of good secondary roads which are passable
in any kind of weather.</p>

<p>Another feature of the festival usually is the presentation of at
least one play by the group of Broadway players who summer at
Abingdon and conduct the famous "Barter Theatre."</p>

<p>Visitors who include White Top and the Barter players in their
itinerary will be delighted with the diversified entertainments
found there.</p>
